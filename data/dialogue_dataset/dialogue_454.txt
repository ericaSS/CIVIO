Doctor:
Self isolate. The current guidelines are if you have symptoms and traveled or been in contact with anyone with confirmed COVID-19, arrange for testing (wear a mask when you go out). Otherwise self isolate for 14 days. If getting worse, also arrange for testing. For more info try whatapps "Hi" to DOH help line: 0600 123456.
