What is the treatment for pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
my son who is 19, suffered from mono last spring with a tonsillar abscess requiring hospitalization for steroid and antibiotic infusion. due to how ill he was, they did not want to remove the tonsils but recommended he have them removed when he improved. he went off to college, became ill, was diagnosed with pneumonia and still had a positive mono spot. so we were unable to schedule it for the christmas break as we planned but now he has a piece of his tonsil that is actually hanging off=it looks like the strands between his cryptic tonsil areas broke off and left this piece dangling. it is umcomfortable but i am not sure if it is emergent. no fever or c/o sore throat right now, but overall still not up to par since this continued bouts of illness.
