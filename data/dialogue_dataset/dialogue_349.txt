Description
Good day. During the lockdown will I be able to travel to my Gynae for my check up?

Dialogue
Patient:
Good day. During the lockdown will I be able to travel to my Gynae for my check up?
Doctor:
In brief:   No.   Most doctors are rescheduling non-essential surgeries, procedures and visits.   You don't want to be in a doctor's office with a bunch of people who may or may not be infected with the Coronavirus.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
