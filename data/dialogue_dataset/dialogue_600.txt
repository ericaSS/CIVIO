Doctor:
In brief:   Coronavirus,   COVID-19 has high affinity to the lung, causing viral pneumonia.   Fortunately, most people get only mild respiratory symptoms. Those who have high risks (age over 65, chronic diseases) tend to get pneumonia and complications. The most important way to prevent the complications is not to get infection, practice common sense of prevention. If you catch the infection, start early treatment.
