Doctor:
In brief:   Monitor.   Stay at home, monitor your temperature, drink fluids and rest.   Nasal congestion and post nasal drip is not typically associated with COVID-19. Watch for dry cough, fever and if your shortness of breath does not resolve, discuss whether you need an inhaler, chest physiotherapy and/or testing. If you have a trach, watch for signs of infection such as more secretions or a change in color .  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
