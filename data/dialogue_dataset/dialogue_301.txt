Patient:
Will I have to be hospitalised if I get the virus, I have type 1 diabetes.
Doctor:
In brief:   Maybe/not   They estimate as many as 80% of those testing positive in the under 40 age group have minor or no symptoms.   Having a non respiratory chronic illness does not increase your risk substantially.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
