Doctor:
In brief:   Cluster cases   I would recommend staying at home, rest, drink fluids and monitoring your temperature.   You may have COVID-19 or another illness. If you are otherwise healthy, await test results. Keep utensils, linens separate and washed. Use good hand washing and disinfect surfaces. If the test is positive, please have screening of all family members in your home. Avoid contact with others.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
