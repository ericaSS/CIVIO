88-year-old male patient enters the Emergency Department of the orally of Marcianise on 02/03/2020.
In the anamnesis he reports diabetes and high blood pressure. It shows previous exams performed in vision: Ultrasound: acute cholecystitis; Chest x-ray: pleural effusion; Blood chemistry tests: polymerase chain reaction 170 milligram / dl with increase of neoplastic markers. Home treatment with Taziocin Bis has already started for 7 days.
"Access: physical examination: T ° 37.1 ° C, diffuse bronchitic finding, painful abdomen on deep palpation, positive Murphy, valid peristalsis, pure heart tones with free breaks, SO2 96%. EGA: mild respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.44, pCO2 34 mmHg), oxygen Hb: 33.4% COHb: 1.7%."
The patient is hospitalized for cholecystitis and bilateral pleural effusion.
"Hematochemical tests, performed at access, show an increase in the inflammation indexes: ESR: 131 millimeter, Fibrinogen: 487mg / dl, Lymphocytes: 13.1%, AST: 114UI / L, ALT: 114UI / L, GT RANGE 188 IU / L, Sideremia 12μg / dl, Ferritin: 4239.00 nasogastric / milliliter, PCR: 12.20 milligram / dl, Procalcitonin: 0.13 nasogastric / milliliter"
"The patient begins antibiotic therapy, with Merrem 1 milligram 3 times / day."
"Performs abdominal ultrasound (which confirms the phlogistic picture of the gallbladder) and chest X-ray (in bed in clinostasis),"
"showing interstitial-alveolar hypodiaphania of the middle-basal field on the left and basal seat on the right, which is associated with pleural veiling on the left)."
"After 2 days, given the lack of response to antibiotic therapy, the increase in body temperature (up to 39 ° C), the onset of dyspnea and the increase in lymphocytopenia, computed/computerized tomography examination of the chest and abdomen is required , performed without and with contrast medium."
"The survey shows widespread thickening of the pulmonary interstitium, with areas of ground glass with predominantly mantle and periscissural localization, distributed to a greater extent to the upper lobes, the lingula and the middle lobe, to a lesser extent also to the lower lobes; bilateral pleural effusion coexists."
"The interstitial-alveolar finding appears suspect for SARS-CoV2: therefore, a rhino-pharyngeal swab is performed, which confirms the clinical suspicion."
