Suggest prognosis for health conditions with pneumonia and congestive heart failure

Dialogue
Patient:
My mom has inclusion body myositis and is 81 years old - she has had the disease for approximately 20 years+ . . .she has been experiencing bouts of pneumonia and congestive heart failure - I am wondering if she will deal with this to the end and if you can tell me what the end will look like?
Doctor:
Hello It is hard to predict her clinical picture. Usually it depends on her heart situation and her treating doctor knows better. Regards Dr.Jolanda
