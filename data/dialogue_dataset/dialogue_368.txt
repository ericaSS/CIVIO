Doctor:
Rash. How long has it been going on?  May be food allergies, most common are dairy products so you could try a week with  no dairy and see if there is a change, others allergens include eggs , wheat.   Could try Zyrtec children's 2 ml once a day and see if it helps itching. Rarely I have seen strep manifest with rash for which  you need a culture.  Speak to a pediatrician on HealthTap prime  or call MD.
