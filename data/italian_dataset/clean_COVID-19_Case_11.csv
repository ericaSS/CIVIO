"Patient of 55 years with urgent URO-CT request in a subject recently undergoing radical robotic prostatectomy with persistent hyperpyrexia, in the suspicion of abdominal collections."
"During the execution of the examination I find the existence of an interstitial inflammatory infiltrate of the lung bases, evident in the cranial scans of the study: it is therefore decided to extend the evaluation also to the chest, which confirms an interstitial pneumonia with a suspected finding for viral pneumonia ."
"After interviewing the patient, he declares that he went shortly before surgery to areas at risk of being infected with Covid-19 and that he had a fever from before the surgery, but was not declared for fear of not being operated on."
