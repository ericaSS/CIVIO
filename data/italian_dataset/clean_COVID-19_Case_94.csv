"From 7 days elevated fever, persistent cough and dyspnoea which is why it presents itself in DEA for dyspnoea."
Performs chest x-ray with multiple bilateral parenchymal thickening report .
"He performed chest computed/computerized tomography on 11/03, assessed by two radiologists with decades of experience of chest computed/computerized tomography, with evidence of bilateral involvement with frosted glass areas, with computed/computerized tomography involvement score of 10 on the right and 3 on the left."
"continuous positive airway pressure is positioned with improvement of symptoms and P / F, but with intolerance to the use of the helmet."
"Plaquenil, Lopinavir / Ritonavir therapy, the latter suspended due to electrolyte disturbance and diarrhea. Following a sudden worsening between the 7th and 9th day of hospitalization, with an increase in fever and P / F 131 in continuous positive airway pressure 50% and positive end expiratory pressure 12.5, on 20/03 we proceed with therapy with Tocilizumab 480 milligram in two administrations after 12 hours (8mg / Kg per dose)"
"48 hours after the second administration there is a clear clinical improvement with definitive disappearance of the fever and gradual passage, alternating the continuous positive airway pressure at VM 50% 12 l / minute with an increase in P / F first at 188 and then at 338 below 50% continuous positive airway pressure and 216 in 50% VM."
Control chest computed/computerized tomography 03/27 which shows a reduction of the frosted glass areas with subpleural parenchymal band aspects with TC score of 8 on the right and 3 on the left.
"In the face of a significant clinical improvement, an equally radiological improvement does not seem to have occurred, as the computed/computerized tomography shows a modest variation of the findings limited to the upper right lobe only."
