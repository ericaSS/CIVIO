Doctor:
Unlikely covid. Unlikely to be corona listening to your symptoms. Stay home and wear masks (anything that covers nose and mouth) proven to decrease transmission by 50%. If you are unwell in terms of respiratory rate (google) >25 or become medically unstable you need to find a corona hospital emergency room. Outside of these conditions stay home and stay safe. The more we all travel in the next 3 days is bad.
