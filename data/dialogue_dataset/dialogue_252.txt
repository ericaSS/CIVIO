Doctor:
Virus. These symptoms are characteristic of a viral upper respiratory tract infection and  treatment is resting, drinking adequate amounts of fluids,taking Tylenol. Worrisome symptoms would be shaking chills, higher fever, chest discomfort with deeper cough,shortness of breath or wheezing which should prompt a call to your MD for instructions. If you live where Covid19 is present,or been exposed get test.
