Doctor:
In brief:   Request a mask   Avoid contact with others, request a mask and ask those around you to wear a mask.   A desk more than 6 feet away from others is another measure of safety. Use good hand washing and keep surfaces, including your phone and computer clean. Continue your steroids as prescribed.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
