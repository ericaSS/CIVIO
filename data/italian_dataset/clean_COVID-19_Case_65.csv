"Male patient, 74 years old, shows up in pulmonary stenosis for chest pain and vomiting for about 12 hours. In history of ischemic heart disease, bronchial asthma and NAO therapy. In pulmonary stenosis pO2 saturation 94%, tachycardic and slightly tachypnoic, apyretic. Cardiological caution and hematochemical and instrumental exams are required to exclude IMA."
Chest x-ray is also performed in standard projections.
The radiographic investigation shows a discrete increase in the peribroncovascular interstitium with associated some parenchymal hypodiafania at the level of the mid-apical field of both lungs with associated parenchymal thickening at the level of the base of the right lung.
"In consideration of the radiographic findings and taking into account the patient's epidemiological link (resident in the city where there are currently more than ten COVID-19 cases), computed/computerized tomography is required for further investigation."
The TC investigation shows the presence of multiple emery glass parenchymal thickenings with associated extensive areas of parenchyma with crazy-paving pattern characterized by the presence of emery glass areas superimposed on smooth thickening of the interlobular and intralobular interstice; concomitant area of ​​parenchymal consolidation in the posterior breach of the right hemithorax and fibrotic outcomes in the posterior breach of the left hemithorax.
The computed/computerized tomography framework is compatible with COVID-19 related pathology; the isolation of the Pz and the nasopharyngeal swab are then arranged (positive result for SARS-CoV-2).
