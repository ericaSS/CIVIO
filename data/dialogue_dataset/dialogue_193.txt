Doctor:
Diabetes + Covid-19. Have you been diagnosed as a Diabetic, or just someone with slightly elevated A1C? Reports are that diabetics, especially males, are at greater risk. Follow all precautions that have been posted all over the internet and have been printed in newspapers. If you have a sore throat and a fever, call your General Physician and follow his/her directions completely.
