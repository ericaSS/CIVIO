Suggest treatment for pneumonia

Dialogue
Patient:
My girlfriend was admitted into the hospital one week ago with pneumonia. A week later ,after being on constant IV antibiotics and fluids, her chest x-ray came back worse than a week ago. Also they have said something about a problem with her kidneys.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Pneumonia is lung infection. If not treated appropriately, it can cause generalized sepsis in the body.This sepsis can damage other vital organs like kidney, heart, liver etc. Since her chest x ray is worsening after 7 days of antibiotic and her kidneys are also-ran showing problem, possibility of severe pneumonia with sepsis is more likely.Best treatment of pneumonia is identification of causative pathogen and start appropriate treatment. For this bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) is needed. BAL culture and sensitivity should be done. Culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. So discuss about bronchoscopy and BAL with your doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your girlfriend. Thanks.
