"Male patient, 47 years old. Remote history changes, not co-pathologies. Onset March 1, 2020 with asthenia, arthralgias, headache, dry cough and pyrexia 39 Â°. pO 2 = 95% in ambient air. pulmonary stenosis access on March 4, 2020."
"Chest X-ray of March 4, 2020: negative"
"In relation to the discrepancy between the clinical picture and the radiological signs, it is decided to perform computed/computerized tomography"
"Standard computed/computerized tomography of March 4, 2020. Reconstruction with lung algorithm on axial and coronal images. There are some nuanced bilateral alveolar infiltrative thickenings in an alveolar interstitium pneumonia at onset."
"Positive COVID-19 swab on March 5, 2020, following the presumptive diagnosis with computed/computerized tomography"
"CLINICAL CARE ROUTE: hospitalization on March 4th and treatment with Ceftriaxone 2gr / day and Azithromycin 500 milligram / day. On March 6, he starts treatment with Kaletra 800 + 100 milligram / day and Plaquenil 400 milligram / day. Significant clinical improvement from 9 March 2020 with recovery of appetite, disappearance of headache and reduction of asthenia, apyrexia, pO2 = 95% in ambient air. On March 10 he performs an X-ray and computed/computerized tomography scan of the Intermediate Check Chest."
"Chest X-ray March 10, 2020. Appearance of pulmonary parenchymal thickenings, some with interstitial changes."
"Standard computed/computerized tomography of 10 March 2020. Reconstruction with lung algorithm on axial and coronal images. The evolution of bilateral foci of alveolar interstitial pneumonia is observed, which take on a more consolidated morphology, with associated reticular opacities. The picture is associated with a clear clinical improvement."
