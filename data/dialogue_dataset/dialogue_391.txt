What are my chances of only getting mild symptoms if I get the virus, because I have type 1 diabetes?

Patient:
What are my chances of only getting mild symptoms if I get the virus, because I have type 1 diabetes?
Doctor:
In brief:   Probable   I know there is a study that shows concern for diabetics, however, this is one study and there are others that show no particular issue.   The data is clear that older, especially older than 70, multiple comorbid conditioins and smoking are critical problems. Although diabetic if it is controlled well it is likely your symptoms will be like most 38 year olds- mild.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
