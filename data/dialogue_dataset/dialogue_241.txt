Description
Hi, I'm on Plasmaquine and Methotrexate 7.5mg x 1 per week for arthritis. I'm concerned that the Methotrexate may weaken my immune system and make me more vulnerable to Covid-19. Would it not be safer to discontinue use untill the threat has passed?

Doctor:
COVID-19 and RA. Some anecdotal data showed that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine might have activity against COVID-19. Observation from China Wuhan noted that patients with RA and on these medications had low incidence of COVID-19 infection. There is however no definite proof yet at this time.  In terms of whether you can stop methotrexate, you better discuss with your rheumatologist for the benefit and risk. .
