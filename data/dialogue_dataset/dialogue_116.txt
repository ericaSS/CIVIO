Now when we have done his sputom test , he has got Gram -ve as 2+, so he is been given medicine doxiflow, and have been asked to go for asthama test. I am afraid if this is really a asthama case
Doctor:
Hello dear , hiWelcome  to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  The asthma is basically restriction of  airway due to  variety of reasons     which may be pneumonia or other .*  Amount of chances depends upon the  severity of pneumonia , host     factors , aggressiveness of  the  treatment  with body response .Hope this clears your query .Regards .
