Description
I have had contact with a co-worker who has now been confirmed as having the corona virus. I don't have any symptoms but my landlords would like me to be tested. Is this possible & how do I do this?

Doctor:
Contact your doctor. In the mean time self quarantine yourself. If you do not have a doctor call your local health resources  to find out where you can be tested. It may be difficult to come by a testing location in some countries.
