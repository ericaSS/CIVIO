Description
Hi! I’ve had a cold since 13 March.  I have since started coughing and just don’t seem to be recovering. One day I will be feeling fine and the next day back to feeling terrible. Lots of tight phlegm and very sore throat.  ?

Doctor:
In brief:   Too soon to recover   On aveage, viral respiratory illnesses may take 2-3 weeks for full recovery and severe cases may take 4-6 weeks.  If your symptoms worsen, you should contact your health care provider to inquire regarding Corona virus testing or quarantine.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
