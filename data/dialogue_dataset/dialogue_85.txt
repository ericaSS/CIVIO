Description
Are frequent nose bleeds and sever cough signs of pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I've been recently having more nose bleeds lately. 4-5 times per day to be exact. And I have the worst cough ever that comes with it. Even when I am asleep my nose starts to bleed and I wake up due to the blood running down my mouth. Is this pneumonia?! Or some other illness?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Pneumonia is less likely to cause nose bleeding. Recurrent nose bleeding with coughing are commonly seen with sinusitis. So better to consult ENT doctor and get done clinical examination and CT scan of paranasal sinuses (PNS). Also get done chest x ray for pneumonia. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia. You may also need endoscopic evaluation of sinuses if CT PNS is suggestive of infection or erosion.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
