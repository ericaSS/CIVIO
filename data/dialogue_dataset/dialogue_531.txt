Patient:

Doctor:
In brief:   Cough of COVID-19   In COVID-19, cough is usually dry, persistent (initially not much different from a cold), then turns into wet with mucus and high fever (pneumonia).   In severe cases, severe shortness of breath and oxygen desaturation can develop after the pneumonia (severe respiratory distress syndrome).   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
