Doctor:
In brief: COVID-19 and Asthma
Great question. Yes asthma is a chronic lung disease which carries some increased risk with COVID-19.
Good asthma control along with good handwashwng, social distancing avoiding unnecessary travel along with your young age should keep your risk of complications low. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity or compromised immune system are also risk factors to be considered.
