Can Imodium be taken while on Doxycycline for pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I was given Doxycycline while in the hospital for pneumonia and took it several days when home. Since March 3rd I have had loose bowels. I took peto-bismol for a week and no help a week ago I started Imodium softgetl and only little help...then I read about probiotics and started taking Ultimate FLORA probiotic 80 billion live cultures.. the question is can I take Imodium also the same day? Thanks
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Imodium is having loperamide. It is not a good drug for diarrhea. So you should not take it. You should definitely take probiotics as they are the first line treatment for diarrhea. Along with probiotics, eat more curd and yogurt. Avoid oily and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Drink oral re-hydration solution (ORS) and zinc tablet. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards, Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar
