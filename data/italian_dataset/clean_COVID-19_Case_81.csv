"74-year-old female patient hospitalized for femur fracture following accidental fall, after 7 days of hospitalization the patient presents hyperpyrexia (38.5 °) with pharyngodynia and mild dyspnea, with SatO2 in of each, equal parts of 90%."
"EGA performed with PO2 of 51mmHg, PCO2 36mmHg, PH 7.48 Sat oxygen 88%. white blood count 3.7 × 1000, Hb 12.6 g / deciliter, polymerase chain reaction 2.22 milligram / deciliter, creatininemia 0.95mg / deciliter, blood sugar 119mg / deciliter, Procalcitonin 0.04 ug / L."
Buffer for Covid-19 and HRCT is performed.
HRCT
"At computed/computerized tomography there are small shaded frosted glass areolas on the pulmonary periphery, center-lobular, of inflammatory-inflammatory significance."
Covid-19 negative swab performed.
"After a few days of relative well-being and stability of the patient, who remains in close monitoring, with mild fever (37.2 °) and stable clinical situation, hyperpyrexia (39 °) reappears with reduced mitral valve and bibasal crackling. Sat oxygen in of each, equal parts of 77%, SatO2 in oxygen of 88-89%."
HRCT is performed and the second pharyngeal swab is then positive.
"The computed/computerized tomography shows bilaterally thickened interstitial-alveolar infiltratives with frosted glass pattern and thickening of the most evident interlobular septa at the lung bases, in subpleural location."
