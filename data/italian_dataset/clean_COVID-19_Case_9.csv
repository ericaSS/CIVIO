"73-year-old female patient, symptomatic of fever and acute respiratory failure."
"At the same time as a chest X-ray taken at the bed, she is intubated in a shock room for further worsening of respiratory failure."
Chest radiograph in bedridden patient: multiple bilateral parenchymal thickenings with widespread interstitial thickening. Increased cardio-thoracic ratio.
"A basal computed/computerized tomography study is subsequently performed with the finding of extensive thickenings in frosted glass, some of which converge in compact thickenings with aerial bronchogram and mainly peripheral disventilative branches."
"At the same time, pharyngeal swab, positive for COVID-19, is performed 24 hours after computed/computerized tomography"
