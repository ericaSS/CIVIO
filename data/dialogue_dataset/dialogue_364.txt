Can the coronavirus leave lung scarring? I thought I heard something about it.

Dialogue
Patient:
Can the coronavirus leave lung scarring? I thought I heard something about it.
Doctor:
In brief:   Yes    like most lung infections there will be changes in the lung structure, probably microscopically and may not be seen on X-rays,  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
