Dialogue
Patient:

Doctor:
Not at all. If you are a well controlled diabetic then you will be fine. You will have an equal risk of getting it. If you are poorly controlled then you are more at risk of it complicating. But boost your immunity and stay at home. Get online shopping. Keep bags outside and sterilize everything coming into your home - entire item. KEep using this forum for questions. :)
