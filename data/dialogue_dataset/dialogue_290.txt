Doctor:
Symptoms. First, symptomatic treatment at home, plenty fluids and rest. Also apply all the preventive measures of social distancing. But if you are aware of any possible contact with an infected person, it is difficult to breath, fever does not low with bath or paracetamol, you are diabetic or with another chronic disease like hypertension, clinical attention should be asked for as soon as possible.
