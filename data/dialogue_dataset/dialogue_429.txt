Patient:
What risk am I from coronavirus as I have VTE?
Doctor:
In brief:   VTE   I am unaware that VTE (Venous thromboembolism) is associated with increased risk for severe infection.   Keep in mind at 42 your risk is low for severe infection. Otherwise do not smoke or start. Consider vitamin D3 and vitamin C and make sure you stay active. Also social distancing is not social isolation. Remember this too will pass!  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
