"Pz Donna, 58, has been reporting wheezing and fever for over a week. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease history and dilated cardiomyopathy with severe congestive heart failure (FE 25%); severe obesity. The patient reports that she has not been in regions and / or cities with epidemic outbreaks nor has she received people from areas at risk."
Chest x-ray required.
The radiographic investigation demonstrates a widespread increase in the peribroncovascular interstitial plot with associated multiple areas of parenchymal thickening arranged in correspondence with the upper field of both lungs.
Heart increased in volume; hypo-expanded but free of pouring costofrenic sinuses.
The X-ray pattern confirms the presence of bilateral interstitial pneumonia strongly suspected for a positivity to COVID-19.
"At the insistence of the radiologist, nasopharyngeal swab is prepared (positive result for COVID-19) and hospitalization in isolation. In this case, the role of the Radiologist was fundamental with the chest X-ray diagnosis only, as the possibility of positive COVID-19 was excluded as there was no epidemiological link."

The subsequent computed/computerized tomography check confirms the characteristic radiological picture of bilateral interstitial pneumonia caused by COVID-19.
