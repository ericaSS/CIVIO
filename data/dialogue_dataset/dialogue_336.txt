Doctor:
In pandemic times... The COVID-19 infection is worldwide, in all but some isolated areas. The goal is to keep people separate so that the clinics and hospitals are not overwhelmed. Patients with medical symptoms should see their primary care doctor on VIDEO or by PHONE, and get instructed to go to a clinic or ER only if not treatable by video or phone. Symptoms of COVID-19 are often the same as a cold or the flu.
