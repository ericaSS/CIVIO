"Male patient, 78 years old, enters DEA for 3 days fever, cough and desaturation. Coming from a rehabilitation facility after fracture of the right humerus."
"Performed recent chest x-ray, negative for thickening."
"Empirical therapy with Ceftriaxone started, but sent to DEA to rule out COVID-19 infection."
"APR: ex smoker, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, psoriasis."
"Home therapy: Atenolol 100 milligram, Metformin 1000 milligram x3, Escitalopram 20 milligram, Omeprazole 20 milligram, Cardioasa 100 milligram, Lorazepam 2.5 milligram, Allopurinol 300 milligram, Paracetamol ab."
"The patient has a T of 38.2 Â° C, with bilateral basal crepitations."
"SpO2: 92% in aa; PCR: 136 milligram / L, LDH: 250 U / L, PCT 0.19ng / milliliter"
A new chest X-ray shows subtle and uneven thickenings spread to the middle and lower third of the left lung field and to the lower third of the right lung field suspected of having Covid-19 infection.
"The nasopharyngeal swab detects the presence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus ribonucleic acid (COVID-19), therefore the patient is hospitalized in Emergency Medicine - Covid."
"At 6 days from hospitalization, a new reassessment with chest x-ray shows ilo-perilary vascular congestion with an increase in the number and extent of bilateral parenchymal thickenings."
"Support is set with continuous positive airway pressure and after a further 4 days, in the suspicion of pulmonary thromboembolism, a chest computed/computerized tomography study is performed with contrast medium (Iopromide 370 milligram / milliliter, 110 ml)"
"with confirmation of widespread and bilateral outbreaks of parenchymal consolidation, with relative savings of the apices, which are associated with areas with a frosted glass appearance; modest bilateral pleural effusion coexists, of greater magnitude on the left: compatible with interstitial pneumonia with consolidative aspects."
There are no thrombus-embolic filling defects within the large branches or main branches of the pulmonary artery.
