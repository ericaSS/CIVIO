Description
I have a sour throat. I travelled to Joburg on 8 March and sat next to a passenger with a face mask and had a running stomach. I now suspect corona infection?

Doctor:
? test. Do you have access to testing? If so perhaps do a telephonic consult ? and get tested and self isolate ? Usually anosmia - loss of smell is an early warning sign but close contact to someone who is positive it's highly contagious.
