Description
Suggest treatment for community acquired pneumonia

Dialogue
Patient:
I am a family doctor in an outpatient family medicine setting, and the question was raised reguarding treatment for community acquired pneumonia. If reoccurance of infection occurs, after treatment with z pack within 90 days how  should patient be treated.
Would it be safe to treat again with levaquin as an outpatient?
Doctor:
HelloIt depends on the age, commodities, immunity status and the cause why the pneumonia is come back again.RegardsDr.Jolanda
