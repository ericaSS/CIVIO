Dialogue
Patient:

Doctor:
Not a bad idea. Many pharmacists also are trying to work from home whenever possible. Your best reference going forward will be your Obs-gyn doc and based on your institution's flexibility and further government regulations either work from home, if possible, or go in maternity leave.
