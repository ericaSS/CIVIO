Patient:
Associated with phlegm and mucus?
Doctor:
Cough,phlegm. At this time your symptoms are characteristic of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, and if your sputum is very discolored, bronchitis may be present. Absence of fever,chills, chest discomfort,shortness of breath or wheezing is reassuring but your MD may recommend starting antibiotic treatment. Leave it to him/her whether covid19 treating is advisable depending upon exposure history.
