Doctor:
Hello dearWarm welcome to Healthcaremagic.comI  have  evaluated your query in depth , I can understand your feelings for your mother .*  She is in advanced stage of the disease , as it must be now drug     resistant  TB by now with multiple relapses .*  You have to accept the condition and give her symptomatic supportive     treatment  as  per  the  narrations  , she is not going to be cured totally     from  this  stage  of  the  systemic  illness .Wishing her fine health ahead .Regards .
