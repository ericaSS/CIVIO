Description
I was severely sick with a cough back in mid February before I knew about the current virus. Not sure if I had a fever or not. I'd cough so hard and vomit. I smoke. Could I still have coronavirus antibodies?

Doctor:
Infectious for 3w. If you had corona virus you are infectious for 3 weeks. So you need to stay 2 m away from loved ones. Stay home. Get someone else to shop for you. Stay home. Wear a buff over your nose and mouth. Do not touch your face, mouth or nose. Wash hands for 20 seconds every 20 min.
