78-year-old female patient with a history of pathological changes.
Pathological history positive for contact with positive Covid-19 patient (husband).
Positive buffer.
"Symptomatic (slight feverish rise, absence of respiratory symptoms)."
"EGA, laboratory tests within the limits of the norm."
Hospitalization of Hub Covid-19.
Buffer repetition after 14 days: 21/03/2020 negative; 03/23/2020 negative.
Pre-discharge chest x-ray is performed on 03/26/2020.
Standard double orthogonal projection chest x-ray (PA and LL)
Widespread modest peribroncovasal pulmonary interstitial reinforcement with nuanced reduction of diaphanous at the mantle site of the left upper pulmonary field (alveolar-interstitial commitment?) Worthy of diagnostic examination by chest CT; no radiographic signs of pleural effusion and bilateral PNX.
computed/computerized tomography scan of the chest is performed without intravenous administration of contrast medium for diagnostic completion.
"Axial images, reconstruction with Lung algorithm, apical, average and basal scan. Ground glass parenchymal thickening with a prevalent peribroncovasal and subpleural distribution, with associated inter- and intra-lobular smooth septal thickening at the LSS, LID and in the postero-basal site of the LIS."
Clinical healing does not correspond to radiological healing.
