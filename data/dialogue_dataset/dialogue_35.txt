Description
Does coughing up of blood in a pneumonia patient need immediate medical attention?

Dialogue
Patient:
I have pneumonia and my doctor has me on strong antibodics and albut in my nebulizer. Yesterday after a treatment I spit up fresh blood and I have this second day also. I m on blood thinners and wonder if that may be my problem. I feel better in other ways.
Doctor:
HelloAs you explain the situation yes it might be that in pneumonia to have blood with the cough and especially if you take blood thinners do not worry.However of it last for several days than better to talk with your treating doctor for this for safety.RegardsDr.Jolanda
