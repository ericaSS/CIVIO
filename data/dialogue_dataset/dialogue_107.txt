Is removal of a lung correct if having pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I ve had pneumonia numerous times always in my left lung. The last time was a year ago, it never went away. My pulmonary explained that the disease is between all the scar tissue. I also have Crohns Disease and am treated with remicade. After several C-Scans which showed a mass and biopsies and cultures which came back negative,I had the left lung completely removed last month and was diagnosed with pulmonary eosinothioia. Does this sound correct?
Doctor:
Hello dearWarm  welcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query in details  .*  According to the narration it was seemingly the correct decision of     surgery  on part of the surgeon as well  as  patient , because  the      medicines  were  not  going to cure it at  all .Wishing you fine recovery .Feel free to ask any further  queries .Regards  .
