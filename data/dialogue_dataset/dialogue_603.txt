Can coronavirus symptoms be mild for some people versus severe? For example, could it just involve being very fatigued, low grade fever for a few days and not the extreme symptoms? Or is it always a full blown cold and struggle to breathe?

Doctor:
In brief:   Symptoms vary.   Some may have no symptoms at all. Some can be life threatening.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
