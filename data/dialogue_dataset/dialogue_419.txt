Hard to guess. If you are living in an area affected with covid-19 pandemic certainly it arouse suspicion if you are infected. Your age is aginst criteria. It may well be what you have is bronchitis or flu. Isolate yourself and get in touch with your doctor preferably via telemedicine to find out about where you can be tested and your treatment path forward. .
