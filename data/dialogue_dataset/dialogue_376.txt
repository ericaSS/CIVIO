Description
I'm finding difficult to maintain precisely 6 ft in grocery stores. Today, as I was leaving, someone entering the store that was (possibly) 3 ft away was coughing lightly and I took a shower when I got home. I'm a hypochondriac. Possible covid-19?

Doctor:
In brief:   It is possible.    You can self quarantin yourself for 2 weeks.   If develop and symptoms especially fever and cough get tested. Since you consider yourself a hypocondriac i suggest to wear an N-95 or surgical mask to prevent similar situations.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
