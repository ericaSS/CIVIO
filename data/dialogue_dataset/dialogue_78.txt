What causes swollen legs while on antibiotics for pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
My sister works in a dialysis center and has had pneumonia twice in the last couple of months. This second bout is fairly recent and was again treated with antibiotics. She has not been able to get rid of the cough and in the last few days developed swelling in her legs as well as a rapid heartbeat. Her bp is normal. Her pcp is sending her for a couple of tests, a lexi and I can t remember the other. Any thoughts.
