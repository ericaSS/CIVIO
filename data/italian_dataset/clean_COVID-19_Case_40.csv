"Patient of 53 years, with arterial hypertension in pharmacological treatment and with recent CT-scan of significant monovasal obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease, on the list for coronary angiography, enters pulmonary stenosis for syncopal episode in the absence of angor, dyspnoea and declining edemas."
The patient at admission is apiretic (T: 36 ° C) and denies potential contacts with patients with COVID-19 or recent stay in areas at risk.
"Laboratory tests at admission show slight reduction in white blood cells (3.47 x10 ^ 3 / ul; vn 4.5 - 10.0) in the absence of significant lymphopenia, increase in fibrinogen (650 milligram / deciliter vn 150-450 ), negative troponin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate within the limits (13 millimeter / h; vn <15)."
In the evening he develops a slight increase in body temperature (T 37 ° C) and performs negative chest X-ray for defined parenchymal alterations.
The following day the patient presented with fever (T 38.5 ° C) and performed computed/computerized tomography
"The computed/computerized tomography examination documents in both lung areas the presence of multiple areas of increased and altered parenchymal density with frosted glass, tending to confluence with consolidation, of which the largest at the apical segment of the upper right lobe, apico-dorsal lobe upper left, lower lingular and more extended to the basal pyramids on both sides, with predominantly mantle arrangement."
No signs of pleural or pericardial effusion. Regular patency of the trunk and main pulmonary arteries. Diffuse sub-and peri-centimetric reactive lymphadenopathy in the peritracheo-broncho-hilar chains on both sides.
"In relation to the strong radiological suspicion, the patient performs a nasal swab for COVID-19 which has a positive result."
