"Female patient, 71 years old, transferred to the DEA from the local pulmonary stenosis with the diagnosis of dyspnea, reported 3 days (39 Â°) fever; Pcs resident in common with multiple COVID-19 cases."
"In a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with moderate respiratory failure. Pz disponoica, tachipnoica, tachycardia with pO2 93% in ambient air. Chest x-ray is required and considering the epidemiological link, swab is performed (positive result for SARS-CoV-2) and isolation of the patient."
The X-ray investigation demonstrates a widespread increase in the peribroncovascular interstitial texture with associated bilateral bilateral parenchymal thickenings arranged in the peripheral location. Pleural effusion on the right with obliteration of the costophrenic sinus on this side.
The Pz is assisted and treated in an MU (department dedicated to COVID-19 patients) and after about 1 week it shows significant improvements as evident from the first control computed/computerized tomography performed about 8 days after hospitalization.
The computed/computerized tomography investigation shows some small nuanced emery glass parenchymal thickenings located in correspondence of the apicodorsal segment of the upper lobe of the left lung and in the middle lobe.
Fair share of pleural effusion in the large cavity on the right with a thin spillage also on the left. Diffuse manifestations of centrolobular and subpleural paraseptal emphysema in the pulmonary parenchyma.
The computed/computerized tomography findings are suggestive for a resolution COVID-19 lung picture.
