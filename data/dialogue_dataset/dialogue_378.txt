Doctor:
RHD. If your rheumatic heart disease hasn't caused weakness of the heart muscle or cardiac arrhythmia it shouldn't predispose you to more complications than anyone else in good health. Keep your resistance and immune system high by avoiding fatigue, dehydration, excessive stress, poor nutrition and exposure to ill people. Practice social distancing. At sign of sore throat gargle with warm salt water .
