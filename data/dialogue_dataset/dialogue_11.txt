Anxiety because of the covid 19 news?

Dialogue
Patient:
Anxiety because of the covid 19 news?
Doctor:
Break. At 39 your risk for severe infections is very low. A strategy that I recommend is taking in information daily, but get away from it. Practice prudent precautions. In my off times away from ER (still practicing front line ER) I focus my mind on my cooking, planning my garden, engage with my friends and loved ones and read.
