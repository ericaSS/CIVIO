If I'm not sure if I have allergies or coronavirus (or something else), should I still stay home?

Dialogue
Patient:
If I'm not sure if I have allergies or coronavirus (or something else), should I still stay home?
Doctor:
In brief:   There are   many online resources to help you distinguish between the two.   But, yes it is a good idea to stay home until told otherwise.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
