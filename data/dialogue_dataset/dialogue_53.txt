What is a right central pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
What is a right central pneumonia? My diagnostic x-ray report states there are hazy densities in the right perihilar and paracardiac areas; trachea is midline; cardiac sillhouette is not enlarged; hemidiaphragms, costophrenic, sulci and bony thoracic cage are unremarkable. I don t understand it.
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 According to the chest X-ray results, this is an infection of the lung tissue. Don't worry. In this case, antibiotics are given. Consult your doctor.
 Regards.
