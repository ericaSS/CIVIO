"Female patient, 20 years old, student. No noteworthy pathology."
"He reaches the emergency room for dyspnea, dry cough and fever (38.5 ° C) for about 5 days; had had no benefit from taking amoxicillin + ac.clavulanic and paracetamol at home."
"He reports having traveled by train from a location in Northern Italy (later declared red zone) to Reggio Calabria; among the contacts, some people subsequently proved positive at Covid-19."
EO: mitral valve reduced in both lung areas.
oxygen saturation: 92%.
ECG: absence of significant alterations.
"Laboratory tests: Leukopenia. Anemia. Increase in polymerase chain reaction, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase values."
The rhino-pharyngeal swab gave positive results for Covid-19.
"The girl was subjected, in urgency, to a computed/computerized tomography scan of the chest in basal conditions and a high-resolution algorithm (HRCT), with a 64-layer scanner, whose images were analyzed with 1.2 millimeter slice-thickness and subsequent reconstructions MPR (axial, sagittal and coronal) and VRT."
"In correspondence of the apico-dorsal segment of the LIS, the presence of a parenchymal consolidation area with subpleural distribution is documented which extends caudally up to the postero-basal segment, with air bronchiologram in the context, which is associated with nuanced parenchymal thickening with a frosted glass appearance ”Located in the adjacent seat."
"No evidence of pleuro-pericardial effusion, nor ilo-medistinic adenopathies. Cardiac image within limits."
"The patient was hospitalized at the UOC of Infectious Diseases of our Hospital, Covid reference HUB for the entire province of Reggio Calabria, giving oxygen and drug therapy. After about three weeks of therapy, the patient presented a noticeable improvement in her overall clinical picture."
"Laboratory investigations gradually tended to fall within the reference values. Swabs were tested for Covid-19 infection, which had negativeized. Thus, after carrying out another HRCT investigation, which documented the complete resolution of the pulmonary parenchymal pathological TDM findings previously described at the entrance, the patient was discharged."
"The case presented highlights the usefulness of Chest computed/computerized tomography, performed with a high resolution algorithm (HRCT), to evaluate well the course and extent of the disease in patients with Covid-19, thus allowing their best management and clinical outcome."
