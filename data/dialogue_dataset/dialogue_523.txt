Description
I have some suspected mulluscum on most of my stomach but it's itchy, inflammed, sentitive, and it's spreading. Aren't most people supposed to around 20 bumps? Why is it peeling so much?  Most of all, what is the best way to treat mulluscum at home?

Doctor:
In brief:   Hard to get rid of   Molluscum is a virus, the less you touch the lesions the less you will spread the infection.   If you want to get rid of it it’s hard, but would suggest a dermatologist rather than the freezing sprays or chemicals used to kill the virus in the skin. There is no ‘limit’ to number of lesions, have not heard that information, but I would not believe that  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
