Doctor:
In brief:   Ingrown toenail   An ingrown toenail can make your foot numb.    I do ER and it is a procedure I will do.  However, many primary providers will do the procedure and podiatrists are a good choice. I do not recommend digging into it at home. However, to prevent future toenail problems do not wear pointed shoes, and let toenails grow to tip of toe and keep at that length.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
