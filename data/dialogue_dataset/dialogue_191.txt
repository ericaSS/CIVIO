On and off fever, sore body?

Dialogue
Patient:
On and off fever, sore body?
Doctor:
Probable flu. This definitely sounds like Influenza is starting.( Unless you have any obvious reason to suspect COVID-19,Malaria,Tick Bite Fever or Glandular Fever).Rest,Vitamin C and a suitable over the counter painkiller. I would advise avoiding Ibuprofen and other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory medication.
