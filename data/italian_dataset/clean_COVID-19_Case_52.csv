"Male patient, 57 years old, with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease positive remote medical history. Smoker. Pathological history of the next change, in particular negative due to contact with positive Covid-19 patients."
He arrives in pulmonary stenosis for the onset of acute dyspnea and therapy-resistant hypepyrexia.
PO2 of 50%; High PCR; Procalcitonin and normal laboratory tests.
Positive buffer.
Chest computed/computerized tomography scan is performed without intravenous administration of contrast medium.
"Axial images, reconstruction with Lung algorithm, apical, average and basal scan."
"Multiple areas of increased frosted glass lung density, in particular in the upper and middle lobes, with a prevalent peribroncovasal and subpleural distribution, which is associated with inter- and intra-lobular septal thickening; areas of parenchymal thickening, with patent air bronchogram in context, at the level of the lower lobes."
Endotracheal cannula.
"Coronal reconstruction, reconstruction with Lung algorithm. Multiple areas of increased lung density with frosted glass, with a prevalent peribroncovasal and subpleural distribution, which are associated with areas of parenchymal thickening with patent air bronchogram in the context, which almost completely engage the LID and LIS. Endotracheal cannula."
