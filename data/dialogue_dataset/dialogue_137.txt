Dialogue
Patient:
My 1 year old daughter has been congested for about 2 days no coughing. Today she was fine this morning other than the stuffy nose. Now she is just laying around, just wants held interested in absolutely nothing and she has projectile vomited 3 times. Pneumonia is going around I know numerous people that have it. Are those symptoms?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Yes, possibility of pneumonia is more.Children don't show high grade fever sometimes.Vomiting can be seen in pneumonia. Chest congestion is classical symptom of pneumonia in children.So better to take her to pediatrician and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray.She may need antibiotics and other supportive drugs.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your daughter. Thanks.
