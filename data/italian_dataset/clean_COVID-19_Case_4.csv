"Fig. 1 and 2 In all the lung lobes, aerial multiple of increased ground glass density are evident. In the subpleural regions of the apical segments of both lower lobes, perilobular arrangement of ground-glass alterations is appreciated."
"Fig. 3 The alterations have a random arrangement, with an almost ubiquitous distribution."
"Fig. 4: Chest X-ray (AP in bed). We compare the chest radiographic examination, performed a few hours before the computed/computerized tomography investigation. Small and subtle bilateral opacities are evident. The radiographic investigation underestimates the degree of lung involvement."
