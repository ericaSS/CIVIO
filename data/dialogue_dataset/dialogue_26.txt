Description
What symptoms would make you think I do not have COVID-19. I have a bad cold, but got diarrhea twice, so does diarrhea mean it is not COVID?

Doctor:
In brief: No
Diarrhea does not rule out COVID.
If you have traveled to endemic areas or met with people that traveled there, you should test if possible.
