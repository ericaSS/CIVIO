Doctor:
In brief:   Cough and cold   Hello and welcome to HealthTap,It is a good idea to get tested.   You can visit your nearest Urgent care. Make sure to call them before coming, after getting tested self quarantine for total 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Please wear mask and perform frequent hand washing. Avoid Ibuprofen/other NSAIDs, use acetaminophen/ Tylenol only. Look for signs of worsening cough & breathing difficulties.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
