Doctor:
Can call Dr on video. Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza, EB virus, or from some other cause such as allergies, irritants, or acid reflux. Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain.
