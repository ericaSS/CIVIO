Doctor:
In brief:   Don't worry    your symptoms are unlikely related to corvid 19, and rather to change of season and smoking cessationtry to use a saline nasal spray and Otrivin nasal spray at least 4-5 times a day don't use Otrivin longer than 10 days  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
