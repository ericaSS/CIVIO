Dialogue
Patient:
Can I get a covid 19 test?
Doctor:
Seek care right away if difficulty breathing, other severe symptoms.
Seek testing if sick, PLUS known Covid-19 contact, or travel to high risk country, or been in facility treating people with Covid-19, or severe pneumonia of unknown cause. Call 0800 029 999 for test. If sick or possibly exposed (not both), stay home. Seek consultation if sick. If known exposure & not sick, self-isolate 14 days.
