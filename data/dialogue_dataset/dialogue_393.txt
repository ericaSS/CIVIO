Doctor:
In brief:   Many possibilities   Seek care right away if difficulty breathing, other severe symptoms.  Seek testing if sick, PLUS known COVID-19 contact, or travel to high risk country, or been in facility treating people with Covid-19, or severe pneumonia of unknown cause.Call 0800 029 999 for test.If sick or possibly exposed (not both), stay home.Seek consultation if sick.If known exposure & not sick, self-isolate 14 days.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
