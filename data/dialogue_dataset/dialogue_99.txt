Description
Prescribed Levaquin, Azrithomycin and amox for strep pneumonia but having nausea and headaches

Dialogue
Patient:
My husband (age 63 and in great health) was diagnosed with strep pneumonia and spent 3 days in the hospital, he was released with antibiotic Levaquin, after 5 days I had to bring him back to the ER because he spiked a fever of 101. They discovered that the original pneumonia of the right upper lung was almost gone but it had spread to the lower lobe. They discharged him with prescriptions for Azrithomycin 500 mg once a day for 7 days and Amox TR-K CLV 875-125 twice a day for 10 days. The Amox is making him very nauseated and he gets headaches from it. Can he stop taking it after 7 days instead of 10? Generally he is feeling better, no fever since beginning the two antibiotic combination?
Doctor:
It will be better if he takes it for 10 days. In order to prevent from nausea and headache you cam give him combination of antacid with antiemetic i.e drugs like PANTOP D OR NUPENTA DSR OR GEMPRAZ DSR ONCE A DAY for the rest of the treatment period.
