Description
What causes excessive tiredness despite taking antibiotics for pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
Hello, On Friday, I was diagnosed with pneumonia and the chest x-ray states Minimal linear subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe. I have been taking an antibiotic since Friday. I am still feeling tired and drained. Is this to be expected with minimal linear subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe?
Doctor:
Hey,Minimal linear atelectasis doesn't mean pneumonia of lung, but still if you are diagnosed as pneumonia then it's ok.And yes tiredness is expected for 4-5 days at least.
