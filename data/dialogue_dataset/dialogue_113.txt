Dialogue
Patient:
I was recently diagnosed with pneumonia. I believe this started from bronchitis. I am now having some mild chest pain after a meal and it goes into both shoulders and can last anywhere from 15 to 90 minutes. Any ideas. This has occured for about two weeks. I am taking ceclor.
Doctor:
Hello dear , hiWelcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  The shoulder pain is in relation with the referred pain from the Phrenic  nerve irritation via pneumonia patch .Hope this clears your query .Wishing you fine recovery .Regards .
