Dialogue
Patient:
well quick question i had pneumonia back in november2013 and theres a concern i have now i took antibiotics s and got better but im simply not all there in the breathing department. lately ive been waking up with a raspy chest but goes away as day progresses also feel as tho if i had dust in my throat when i manage to get the plegm out its not all colorful its just clear. i get a tight chest feelings sometimes albuterol does help before exerting myself/ excersise.
Doctor:
Hello,Since, you are feeling better after albuterol (inhaled bronchodilator), possibility of bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is more likely for your symptoms.Bronchitis is common after lung infection (pneumonia). So, it is better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar
