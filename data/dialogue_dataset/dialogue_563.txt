Description
I heard ACE inhibitors might exacerbate coronavirus. I also heard NSAIDs might do the same. Does this mean any common meds could have an unexpected effect during coronavirus?

Doctor:
In brief:   Coronavirus and ACEI.   Recent publications including the one from the lancet showed COVID-19 binds to ACE-2 receptor on target cells for entrance.   The expression of ACE-2 receptor is substantially increased in patients with diabetes who were treated with ACE inhibitors or ARB. NSAIDS has the similar effect. All medications can have some unexpected side effects.    Would you like to video or text chat with me?
