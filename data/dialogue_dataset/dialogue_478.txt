Patient:
Can a person with type 1 diabetes ever just get mild symptoms of coronavirus, or will it always be fatal?
Doctor:
In brief:   Death   At 38 your risk of death from the virus is low.    If you diabetes is controlled you should not have particularly higher risk. Poorly controlled diabetes would make a difference.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
