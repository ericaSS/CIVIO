"Female patient, 49 years, accesses the DEA through Service 118 with high fever and dry cough for 7 days, already being treated with Azithromycin and Paracetamol without any benefit. He has been reporting anosmia for about 2 weeks. Pathological history and remote and near mutation, which is also negative due to certain contact with positive Covid-19 patients."
PO2 of 85%; leukopenia (especially lymphopenia); increase in polymerase chain reaction and lactate dehydrogenase
Chest X-ray investigation (1 pr.)
"Presence of multiple and nuanced areas of hypodiaphaly, partly pseudonodular in appearance, borne by both hemithorax, with a predominantly peribronchial distribution, with associated reinforcement of the interstitial texture and peribronchial thickening, more evident in the ilo-peri-ilar and mediobasal bilaterally."
"In the basal center there are some areas delimited by radiopaque streaks, possible emphysematic manifestations. Bilateral medium-basal disventilator phenomena."
To complete the HCRT exam with a 64-layer scanner (140 kV; 100 mAs; pitch 1.5 and collimation of 0.6 mm). The images were reconstructed with 1 millimeter slice thickness. Subsequent MPR reconstructions are performed on the coronal plane.
"Presence of multiple parenchymal thickenings located in the sub-mantle, mainly with consolidated aspect and aerial bronchogram, more evident in correspondence of the lung bases."
"Some thickenings with a frosted glass appearance are associated, always distributed sub-mantle and located mainly at the level of the upper lobes. No pleural or pericardial effusion."
A nasopharyngeal swab is then performed which is positive for COVID-19.
The patient is hospitalized at the Department of Infectious Diseases of our Polyclinic and the following medical therapy is set:
"- Kaletra, Plaquenil, Tolicizumab"
"- Ceftriazone, Azithromycin"
"On the 6th day, the patient showed modest but progressive improvement of the clinical and laboratory framework, with a moderate decrease in polymerase chain reaction and lactate dehydrogenase values. orally 2 of 94%. Leukopenia persists. On the 7th day, the radiological picture is then reassessed with HCRT"
"Compared to the previous exam, there is a clear reduction in the extent of the thickening previously reported; Focal areas of altered density with frosted glass appearance at the level of the upper lobes and thickenings with lamellar aspect in the left basal site remain (the latter to refer to partial re-expansion of the previous lung parenchyma involved)."
Unchanged the remaining finds.
