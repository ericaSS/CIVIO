Description
Suggest treatment for pneumonia after going through chemotherapy

Dialogue
Patient:
Hi, My uncle has been diagnosed with liver cancer and he is in the last stage. After the first chemotherapy he has been admitted to hospital due to pneumonia. Is he again diagnosed with lung cancer? And what are the chances of getting cure? What treatment you would like us to get it done.
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 Though this question requires all reports as scanned copy to be evaluated, with provided data I can suggest that
- Any of the treatment would be supportive only for advanced case of liver cancer, it is not going to be curative.
 Thanks.
