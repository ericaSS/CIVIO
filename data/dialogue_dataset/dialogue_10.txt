Is vomiting and diarrhea a symptom of covid-19?

Dialogue
Patient:
Is vomiting and diarrhea a symptom of covid-19?
Doctor:
COVID-19 symptoms. Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occur fairly frequently early in the infection, but are rarely if ever the only symptoms. If cough and fever don't develop within a day or two after vomiting or diarrhea, probably it isn't COVID-19.
