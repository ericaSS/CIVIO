What causes odour while coughing after treatment with antibiotics for pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
My husband has advanced M.S.  After battling a cough for a month, he had a chest X Ray and we were told he had pneumonia. He was on an antibotic for 10 days which ended 1 week ago today. His nurse was here halfway through the dose and said his lungs sounded clear  He has not been coughing or a temprature in over a week. This evening he started coughing, phlegm is not discolored but when he coughs there is a strange odor that I can not describe. I have never smelled an odor like this
Doctor:
