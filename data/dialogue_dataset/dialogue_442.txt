Doctor:
In brief:   Tummy Bug   GI symptoms are rare with Coronavirus.    SOB and Dry cough and fever common. Testing should lead to a purposeful action and at this time there is none. That is there is no medication to get and treatment for the virus is rest and social isolation which you do not need a test to do. If you do get cough and SOB then notify your provider and get checked. The virus typically runs for 10 to 14 days.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
