Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having bronchospasm which is causing this suffocating feeling. Pneumonia causes inflammation in airways and this in turn causes bronchospasm. So in my opinion, you should ask your doctor about starting inhaled bronchodilators like formoterol or salmeterol to relieve bronchospasm. Also avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
