Just wanted to check I had a meeting with someone who had recently been back from Australia, is Australia a high risk country?

Doctor:
In brief:   Travel is a risk   Any travel is a risk, that is how this has spread so yes I would advise you telephonically consult with a doctor and see what they advise is best right now.   But locking down requires all of us to stay put to stop transmission. I mean international travel is a risk to get covid and from international folk, especially recently. Travel right now to expose yourself and others is also a risk.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
