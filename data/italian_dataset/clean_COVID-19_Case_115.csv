"51-year-old man showed up at our emergency department with 8-day fever, chest tightness and mild dyspnea. The remote pathological history was negative. In a recent medical history, the patient reported traveling to Milan for work in the last week of February 2020 and denied any contact with patients with COVID-19 infection."
"At the entrance, her body temperature was elevated to 38.9 Â° C. Laboratory tests showed normal values, especially white blood cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes."
Performs TC
"Thoracic computed/computerized tomography without contrast medium documented the presence of ground glass (GGO) opacities with subpleural and peribroncovascular distribution of the left upper lobe (LSS) and lingula (Fig. 1, 2, 3); the left lower lobe (LIS) and the right lung were normal. The radiological diagnostic hypothesis, formulated on the basis of imaging, was viral pneumonia (SARS-CoV-2 infection), confirmed by the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [1, 2 ]."
"The patient was discharged after 20 days of hospitalization for resolution of the clinical symptomatology and after performing double swab, both of which were negative."
"After 40 days the patient was followed up by computed/computerized tomography scan of the chest without contrast medium that documented partial regression of the known GGO alterations previously reported to the LSS and lingula (Fig. 4, 5, 6)."
Discussion
"COVID-19 pneumonia tends to manifest itself on thoracic computed/computerized tomography investigation in the form of bilateral subpleural GGO opacities with air bronchogram, poorly defined margins and a slight predominance in the right lower lobe [3-5]. These pulmonary computed/computerized tomography patterns are highly nonspecific and may overlap with the radiological signs of hemagglutinin type 1 and neuraminidase type 1 influenza, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, other coronaviruses (SARS, MERS) or atypical pneumonia [6-8]."
Pan et al [9] studied 21 patients with COVID-19 at intervals of approximately 4 days from the beginning of the disease until clinical recovery by thoracic computed/computerized tomography investigations. They defined 4 stages of lung involvement in computed/computerized tomography and documented that pulmonary changes in thoracic computed/computerized tomography show maximum severity about 10 days after the onset of symptoms.
"This case report illustrates unilateral and unilobal pulmonary involvement in a patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 swab infection and with 8-day respiratory symptoms. Although the presence of unilateral lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia suggests that the disease is in its early stage, we hypothesize that these computed/computerized tomography findings of unilateral and unilobal involvement may also be present in the progressive clinical phase."
