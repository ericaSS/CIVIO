I’m so Scared that I will die if I get the coronavirus, due to type1 diabetes?

Patient:

Doctor:
Coronavirus. Stay calm. Most people with coronavirus infection only get mild respiratory symptoms, especially among younger patients. Diabetes and use of ACEI or ARB may increase your risk of infection. Practicing common sense of prevention is critical during this outbreak crisis. Avoid risk exposure, wash hand, wear mask as needed. Get tested if you develop symptoms. Effect drugs are coming. .
