Description
Is mild intermittent asthma an elevated risk group for Covid 19 complications? If so, should I continue to use my inhalers when it's occasionally necessary or will the steroids in them put me at more risk? Thank you.

Doctor:
In brief: Maybe
Being over 50 with a medical condition like intermittent asthma makes you at higher risk for any respiratory illness including COVID19.
It appears to be less an issue for children and youth.
