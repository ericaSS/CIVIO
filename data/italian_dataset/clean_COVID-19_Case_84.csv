"From a laboratory point of view, leukocytosis is documented, a significant increase in the values ​​of procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase and polymerase chain reaction"
"On computed/computerized tomography examination (axial and coronal reconstructions) a widespread picture of ground glass is documented in both pulmonary parenchymes with peripheral distribution, mainly involving the lingula and the lower lobes (in particular in the posterior segments). The finding is suggestive of medium-high viral interstitial disease."
"In reconstructions with a mediastinum filter, an increase in the size of the cardiac chambers is also detectable, which is associated with a modest pericardial effusion."
"The swab is made, which confirms the positivity for Covid-19. The patient is intubated and hospitalized in the resuscitation-Covid department of our hospital. Subsequently, it worsens its clinical conditions, up to the exit (4 days after the computed/computerized tomography examination)."
