Description
Can your only symptoms on coronavirus start as tightness of chest and shortness of breath? I’ve had this for a week now. My body aches a bit, hard to tell if this from trying so hard to breath. Nose occasionally runs, throat a little sore.

Doctor:
Possibly. if you had your symptoms for a week and they haven't gotten worse or developed into a fever, you probably do not have COVID-19.IF you are still worried see your PCP.
