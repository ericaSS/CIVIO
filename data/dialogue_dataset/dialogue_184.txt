Description
Some doctors think that the combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin may be effective against COVID19. They believe this the only option we have until a vaccine becomes available. At least it is worth trying. Do you agree?

Doctor:
Hard to say. In the absence of treatment I guess we grasp at things. This is definitely doing the rounds but as yet unproven. Most people recover from covid. So very very hard to trial. Most important right now is not to spread it. So stay home. Wash hands.
