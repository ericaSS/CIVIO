"Male patient, 57 years old, transported since 118 for fever, cough and dyspnoea especially in the last 3 days."
"Deny contacts with positive COVID-19 people and places at epidemiological risk. In pulmonary stenosis 90% pO2 saturation, tachypnoic with 39 Â° fever. In anamnesis he denies noteworthy pathologies."
Chest x-ray required
Chest x-ray demonstrates a thickening of the peribroncovascular interstitial plot with some nuanced parenchymal hypodiafania at the base of the left lung.
In consideration of the symptomatology integration with computed/computerized tomography examination is required.
THORAX TC
The investigation shows the presence of multiple parenchymal thickenings in emery glass and some areas with crazy-paving pattern characterized by the presence of emery glass areas superimposed on smooth thickening of the interlobular and intralobular interstice with associated areas of parenchymal consolidation.
The computed/computerized tomography picture is characteristic for a related COVID-19 pathology and for this reason the Pz is placed in isolation and the nasopharyngeal swab is carried out (SARS-CoV-2 positive result).
