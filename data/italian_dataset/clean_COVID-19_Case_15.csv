"46-year-old female, non-co-pathological, asymptomatic. 98% pO2 saturation is detected in ambient air. He reports nonspecific low back pain about 10 days ago, resolved spontaneously. In cohabitation with her husband (case 14), whom she accompanies, without personal protective equipment."
"CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC PATH: following the radiological diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia of the husband, it was decided to subject the woman, although asymptomatic, to Standard Radiogram of the chest and subsequently to Basal computed/computerized tomography of the chest."
chest X-ray
Chest x-ray: thickening of the peribroncovascular interstitium in the lower left pulmonary field. Multiple areas of small parenchymal thickening on the left both in the upper and lower lung field and on the right in the upper right lung field. No pleural effusion. Heart and small circle within limits.
Chest computed/computerized tomography
"Chest CT: multiple areas of parenchymal build-up in different stages of consolidation, some with aerial bronchogram, with greater peribronchial, periscissural and subpleural distribution. Not significant ilomediastinal lymphadenomegaly. No pleural effusion."
"The picture is consistent with the inflammatory pulmonary phenomenon. The patient is accompanied to the emergency room, subjected to a pharyngeal swab and subsequently discharged at home, in isolation."
