39-year-old female patient; access to the Emergency Department of Vigevano on 10/03 due to the onset of fever in the health worker (nurse).
"Hematochemical tests substantially normal, with the exception of monocytosis (monocytes 16.0%), in particular white blood count and Reactive Protein C within limits."
"Orthostasis chest x-ray performed with double projection, without evidence of relevant pathological findings."
Nasopharyngeal swab was performed at the same time and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
"RX revaluation on 20/03, without evident modifications of the findings compared to the previous one."
"Continuing the symptomatology (serotin fever, asthenic state with easy fatigue and persistent cough), an in-depth computed/computerized tomography scan performed on 01/04 was required."
"Plenty of nuanced shaded glass areola are appreciated in the dorsal areas of both lower lung lobes, without parenchymal consolidation. In the lung segments not affected by the findings just described, there are no widespread alterations of the interstitium. No pleural effusion."
The case presented confirms the limited sensitivity of the X-ray examination and the usefulness of computed/computerized tomography in case of discrepancy with clinical data.
