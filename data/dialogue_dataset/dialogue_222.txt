Doctor:
Consider chest image. Pneumonia may occur and if you continue to spike fevers, please see your PCP for a chest image and reevaluation. Testing for additional bacterial and viral causes may be performed at the same time. Stay at home at least for three days after the fever has broken and avoid contact with others. .
