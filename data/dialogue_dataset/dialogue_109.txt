Suggest treatment for pneumonia

Dialogue
Patient:
I was diagnosed with double pneumonia 1 week ago having had the symptoms for a week, I have been on heavy penicillin and am left with weakness and a bad cough. My query is that my urine is reddish brown, looks like some blood could be there. Is this part of pneumonia. Thank you for your time. Jean aged 72 and normally healthy except for overweight.
Doctor:
Hello dear Jean , hiWarm  welcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query in details  .* The urine color is in relation with side effect of penicillin , not a part of pneumonia .*  Has to be   addressed  immediately  to  your  treating  doctor for  this    issue .Wishing you fine recovery .Welcome for any further  guidance .Regards  .
