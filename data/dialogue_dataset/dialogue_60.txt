Dialogue
Patient:
How many tablets of Levofloxoacin would it take for a older person who is be told he is just coming down with pneumoria (he already has taken 4 pills & I am to give him another at 4 oclock, the reason I am asking this question is he had a fall & broke his hip but seem to have confusion & I had the doctor give him medicine for the confusion, but can not start it until he finish 6 more pill, thank you for any help you can give me.
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 Levofloxacin is generally advised once a day. It's very effective for pneumonia. The dose is generally to be taken once a day for arrest 10 days. This can be up to 14 days for some. patients.so yes give him one tablet daily for 6 more days.this hopefully would be enough for his pneumonia.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
