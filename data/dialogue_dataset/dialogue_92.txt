Description
Suggest remedy for low blood pressure in pneumonia patients

Dialogue
Patient:
My 80 year old wife is home recovering from pneumonia (double) twice in August. Her blood pressure has dropped to 82/44. How dangerous and how can I increase the level. Hospital sent her home with oral antibiotics the first time, no antibiotics the second time. She has been treated for this disease 4 times in past 12 months.
Doctor:
Low blood pressure can be a serious and life-threatening problem. Is her blood pressure normally a lot higher than this? If so, then I would suggest urgent evaluation by a physician. Infections can lead to a response called sepsis, and part of this may include a drop in blood pressure, which can be dangerous to her organs. Ensuring adequate hydration is important, as dehydration can cause low blood pressure as well. If she is acting confused, fatigued, or more tired than usual then I would suggest urgent medical evaluation. I hope she feels better.
