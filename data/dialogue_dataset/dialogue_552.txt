Doctor:
Monitor temp. Most cases of COVID-19 are associated with symptoms, but not all. Your symptoms may be related to coronavirus infection or another infection. I would recommend that you be tested for Coronavirus and then stay inside, avoiding contact with others while awaiting your test results. Use good hand washing, disinfect surfaces and drink fluids.
