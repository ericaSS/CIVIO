Dialogue
Patient:
Hi, I have a friend who is a female, age 16 and has complaints of light-headedness, migraines, blurry vision, can t breathe in deep without coughing, complains of body aches, chills, and a fever. She is going to the ER tomorrow because they are unable to go today due to being snowed in. It sounds like pneumonia but not sure.Thank you for your help
Doctor:
HiYes it might be but not completely.To be sure she should consult her doctor for further follow up.Wishes Dr.Jolanda
