I’m so scared of the coronavirus with my diabetes, that I’m wondering if my wife should not work in her GP practice? It’s putting us both at major risk isn’t it?

Doctor:
Good question. Awareness and precautions are important, but your wife plays a valuable role for those who have contracted the disease. She will be at higher risk than the general population and we are seeing HCPs contracting Covid-19. There is no one correct answer to this question because situations vary. Best option is for your wife to discuss this with her employer and take precautions. Good luck!
