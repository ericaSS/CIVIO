I started a cough in 2009 that was diagnosed as severe bronchitis and then a couple years I had pneumonia twice and now I ve got combination of bronchitis and pneumonia bad cough. I just had a second CT scan one was August 22nd and the other one was October 23rd and I ve never been told a diagnosis before but I happened to see it on my chart What: Hospital Outpatient Visit with LKS CT 1 When: Monday October 23, 2017 7:30 AM (30 minutes) Where: Lakeside Hospital Cat Scan (Lakeside)Diagnosis: Interstitial lung disease.I am going November 27th to discuss this diagnosis I hope I was just told I don t have COPD and then I get this lung disease which I ve never heard of and it doesn t have a very good survival rate I m 63 female.
Doctor:
Hello,CT scan is diagnostic for interstitial lung disease (ILD). It can develop after the age of 60 years especially if the patient is having bronchitis and recurrent pneumonia.Yes, you are right about survival. It is not having a good prognosis.But, now dayâ€™s newer treatments like Pirfenidone and N acetylcysteine (NAC) drugs are available. So consult pulmonologist and discuss these newer treatments.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar
