Description
I am unaware of being in contact with anyone showing Covid-19 symptoms. I've only been to the shops yesterday. I've been stressing about the whole pandemic and will seldom go to sleep after 11 each night. Could it be lack of sleep or anxiety at play?

Doctor:
Yes. Could well be and that is very normal. SEe how you go, you do have some worrying symptoms. Try to do a telephonic consult and if you have access get tested. In the interim self isolate and listen to Cyril's advice. Be calm, we are here.
