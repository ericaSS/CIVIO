"Male patient, 57 years old. Hypertension and dyslipidemia, under pharmacological treatment."
"He reaches the emergency room for dyspnea, dry cough and fever (38.5 ° C) for about 7 days; he had had no benefit from taking paracetamol at home."
"He reports that he has had no contact with positive Covid-19 patients, although he comes from a location in the province declared a red zone, near Melito P. Salvo."
"EO: mitral valve reduced in both lung areas, with bi-basal rattles."
EGA: mild hypoxia. oxygen saturation: 85%.
ECG: absence of suggestive alterations for ischemia.
"Laboratory tests: leukopenia; significant increase in polymerase chain reaction, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase values. The values ​​of D-Dimero and Troponina were within the limits."
Chest X-ray (projection in forced supine position):
"Presence of nuanced parenchymal thickenings, in part with pseudo-nodular appearance, in both hemithorax, with greater evidence in bi-basal site. Reinforcement of the interstitial texture and peri-bronchial thickening, bilaterally. Thickened them. Veiling (pleurogenic) of both SCFs."
"An emergency computed/computerized tomography scan of the thorax under basal conditions and a high resolution algorithm (HRCT) is performed urgently, with a 64-layer scanner, whose images were analyzed with slice-thickness of 1.2 millimeter and later MPR reconstructions (axial, sagittal and coronal)."
"HRCT has documented, in both lung parenchymes, the presence of multiple thickenings with a frosted glass appearance and some areas with a crazy-paving pattern, due to the coexistence of ground-glass areas, interstitial consolidation and thickening. Trachea and patent bronchi."
"Some small, reactive lymph node in the ilo-mediastinal site. Cardiac image within limits. No evidence of pericardial effusion. Minimum bilateral basal pleural effusion."
"The computed/computerized tomography also clearly highlighted the spider web sign , represented by an area of ​​ground-glass opacity, with a roughly triangular and angular appearance, in the sub-pleural basal site on the right, with interlobular septa thickened inside like a net; the adjacent pleura was stretched and thickened, denoting a shape similar to that of a spider web in the corner."
"Rhino-pharyngeal swab performed, which gave positive result for Covid-19."
"In consideration of the worsening of the clinical conditions, the patient is admitted to the UOC of Infectious Diseases of our Hospital, Covid HUB of reference for the entire province of Reggio Calabria, promptly establishing multi-drug therapy and high-flow O2-therapy."
"On the seventh day of therapy, the patient showed a modest, but progressive, improvement in the clinical and laboratory picture, with a moderate decrease in polymerase chain reaction, lactate dehydrogenase values; leukopenia stable. The HRCT survey was repeated on the tenth day, to re-evaluate the radiological picture, which documented, in both lungs, a reduction in both parenchymal thickening with a frosted glass appearance, and in areas with crazy-paving pattern, which however were still present in the middle fields and peripherally, bilaterally."
"The thickening / stretching of the visceral pleura in the right posterior basal site still persisted, from which parted septa and branches with a fibrosclerotic aspect. The pleural effusion was no longer visible."
"The patient continued, although slowly, to improve his general clinical picture, and also laboratory investigations, progressively, tended to fall within the reference values."
"During the third week of treatment, swabs for testing Covid-19 infection had negativeized. Thus, after carrying out another HRCT investigation, which documented the almost complete TDM resolution of the bilateral thickenings and bilateral parenchymal pathological findings already described, the patient was discharged."
"The case presented highlights the usefulness and importance of HRCT, as well as in the early stages of diagnosis, also for well evaluating the course and severity of the disease, thus directing towards the best patient management / clinical outcome."
