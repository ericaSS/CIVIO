Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 In my opinion, you should definitely consult pulmonologist for this pain. You will need a chest X-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). A chest X-ray is needed to rule out recurrence of pneumonia because this can also cause similar kind of pain. PFT is needed to know the severity of asthma. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (Formoterol or Salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (Budesonide or Fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. 
 Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
