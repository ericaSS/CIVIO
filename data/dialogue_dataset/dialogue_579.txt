Doctor:
Bacterial likely. Use nasal saline rinses, a nasal steroid and discuss the use of Augmentin for 10 days with your PCP. It is more likely that you have a bacterial infection. An examination of your mouth or uploaded photo to a HT virtual consultation is important. Avoid smoke and if you are a smoker, please consider a biopsy of the area. .
