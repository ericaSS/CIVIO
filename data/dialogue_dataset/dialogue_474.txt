Hello, I need to go to my Dr. to get my prescription refilled. Due to the corona virus I really don't want to get out and sit in a busy office just for a prescription refill.   Perscription refill?

Doctor:
In brief:   May do video consult   COVID-19 pandemic at this time, so one's doctor may want to consult by video instead of requiring an in-person visit.   Some medications are refillable by video, others are not. In this pandemic, one's primary care doctor, who knows the patient well, can usually get meds to the patient without an in-person visit... unless an exam is needed in order to adjust the meds. Just ask the doctor.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
