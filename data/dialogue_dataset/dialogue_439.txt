Description
Hi I asked a specific question to a Dr 2 days ago and haven’t heard anything back. I basically need a referral letter to get a Covid test done. It’s that simple. I travelled to Cape Town but attended an event with over 400 people from all over?

Doctor:
See your physician. Your personal physician can give you this letter. This forum is for answering general medical/dental questions.
