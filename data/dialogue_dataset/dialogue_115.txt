Could the fever,wheezing and lung ache be pneumonia relapse?

Dialogue
Patient:
Hello. About 3-4 weeks ago I was diagnosed with pneumonia. After two weeks I felt well enough to start getting back out, but I continued to cough up mucus. I got in the swimming pool last night and it was an outdoor pool and kind of cool. this morning I woke up with fever, wheezing bad and my back in my lung area hurts so bad. The coughing is getting worse too. Could the pneumonia have came back or never left? What should I do?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Swimming pool water is full of organisms. So possibility of relapse of pneumonia is more likely because your symptoms, coughing, wheezing, chest pain are more suggestive of pneumonia. So consult your doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray. If chest x ray is showing fresh infiltrates then you will need another course of antibiotics, mucolytic and expectorant drugs. Avoid swimming for atleast 1 month.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
