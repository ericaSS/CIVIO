"Male patient, 55 years of age. No known comorbidities at the time of diagnosis. The patient presented with hyperpyrexia and cough on 24/02/2020, after contact with a positive patient, for which he was subjected to home quarantine."
"On 1/3/2020, respiratory failure arose, so he was subjected to chest computed/computerized tomography without contrast medium, which showed a picture of multiple thickenings with ground glass density."
On 6/2/2020 with substantially stationary clinical picture he underwent a control computed/computerized tomography
In the scans it can be seen that part of the ground glass thickenings evident at the computed/computerized tomography level of 1/3/2020 are reduced in density and in some cases reduced in size with a concomitant appearance of new thickenings adjacent to the previous ones and in some cases the enlargement of the thickenings previously reported.
Pleural effusion and mediastinal lymphadenomegaly were not observed in both CTs.
The computed/computerized tomography of 1/3/2020 shows thickenings at the submantellar and paravertebral level of the LSS which appear reduced in the computed/computerized tomography of 6/3/2020.
"Appearance of new thickened frosted glass at the level of the anterior segment of the LSS, of the lateral segment of the middle lobe and of the apical segment of the LID and LIS."
"However, a lower density of the more medial portion of the thickening of the LSS compared to the previous one is observed."
Reduced the density of the thickening at the level of the lateral basal segment at the paravertebral level and the appearance of new thickening at the lateral side.
