Is coughing and chest heaviness related to bronchitis or pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I have been sick with a sinus infection and tonsillitis over the last week and a half. i am on antibiotics for these. Now I feel it in my chest. I am coughing non stop. My throat doesnt hurt much just from the coughing. My chest feels heavy and I have some issues with breathing. Could this be bronchitis or pneumonia ?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your symptoms are seen with both, bronchitis and pneumonia. And both of these them are common after upper respiratory tract infection (URTI - sinusitis). So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed for the diagnosis of pneumonia. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for pneumonia. Inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment for bronchitis. So first diagnose android then start appropriate treatment.. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
