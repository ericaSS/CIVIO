Doctor:
In brief:   Can give Dr. a call.   Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza (antibiotics usually not used), or from other causes such as allergies, irritants, or COVID-19.   Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 tends to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
