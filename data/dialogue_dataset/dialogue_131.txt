Dialogue
Patient:
Dear Dr.Mahashur, i have been diagonised with 'MYCOPLASMIC PNEUMONIA' by a Dr in Singapore,(mycoplasmic pneumonia antibody fbc=  >1:1280) and am now on a 20-days course of 'avelox' ( moxifloxacin 400 mg) and have also been advised to take steroids for 10 days. I have already gone through a course of antibiotics to treat pneumonia (CLAVICEF)and TB has been eliminated by carrying out a bronchoscopy and lab analysis for TB. I am apprehensive about taking steroids, so pls advise if it is necessary to take steroids? thanks.
Doctor:
