Patient:

Doctor:
In brief:   Appears as though   this was asked before? She should disrobe immediately upon entering the home, place clothes in laundry and then shower. You need to keep A1c as low as possible, do everything you can to support gut health and immunity and increase supplements that increase resistance to viruses.   Sleep apart... your call!  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
