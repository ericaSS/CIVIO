Doctor:
In brief:   Consider asthma    Have you ever had asthma or wheezing? That can cause tightness & shortness of breath, as can certain heart problems.   Without fever & cough, COVID 19 is less likely, but probably best to call your Drâ€™s office for recommendation.  If the breathing worsens you should be seen ASSP by video visit or perhaps in person to listen to lungs & assess need for possible chest X-ray, EKG, & medication  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
