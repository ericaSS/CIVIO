Description
Just found out that my MD tested positive for Covid-19. I had direct interaction with him. He has no symptoms, he was tested because he traveled in February to Switzerland. Should I be tested. I’m 67, or wait to see if I develop any symptoms.?

Per RSA NICD: Self-isolate for 14 days.Seek testing if sick.Call 0800 029 999 for test information.Seek consultation if sick, preferably by phone or telemedicine.Seek care right away if difficulty breathing, other severe symptoms.Good luck, from the United States!
