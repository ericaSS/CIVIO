Doctor:
In brief:   Many causes.   Most cases of COVID-19 with symptoms are associated with fever, however milder cases do occur. Your shortness of breath and difficulty breathing may have a number of causes and should be evaluated.   Please call your PCP. Avoid dust, mold, smoke, animal dander, pollen. Your symptoms also are consistent with an allergic reaction.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
