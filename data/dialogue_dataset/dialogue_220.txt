Description
My 68 yrs old mom still waiting for corona virus test results. She’s had 101-102 fever for a week CT showed pneumonia she is at the hospital now . Does the fact that her fever is not getting better means that her pneumonia isn’t getting better?

Doctor:
In brief:   One sign   On treatment for bacterial pneumonia, fever will usually decline within 2 days.    A follow up chest image may be indicated. If you would like to upload her CT and clinical information to an inbox consultation with HT, we can provide an opinion. Sometimes there is slow resolution of a pneumonia, particularly with underlying medical conditions. The test results should be back soon.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
