Dialogue
Patient:
My son is 4 years old. At the age of six months he suffered from pneumonia.since then he has problem of coughing at the interval of 1 to 2 month. The doctor provided bactoclav and beta2 cough syrup till he became 2 years old. But there is no any improvement so the doctor refered budecort 200mcg/dose 2 puff at a time twice a day n also a nasal spray beclometason dipropionate bp 50 micro gram. But still the case is not improve. The frequency of coughing starts almost every months. Please suggest me what could I do now?
Doctor:
Hello As you explain the history it might be a gastric reflux present that has caused the pneumonia. Discuss with his doctor. Regards Dr.Jolanda
