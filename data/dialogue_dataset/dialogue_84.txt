Dialogue
Patient:
my mother was diagonesed with multiple myloma after a hip fracture surgery 5 yrs ago by Dr Mathews at St. Stephens. She was treated for the cancer at aiims. the disease has advanced now and as a result she developed aspirational pnemonia . Due to a knock down incident we rushed her to Max hospital on 19th jan and ever since she is on the ventilator all though some antibiotic is being administered there is talk of trichotomy for her. since its nt possible to take her home and in her stage more than anything palliative care is reqd. Max being to expensive is nt sustainable. is stephens the right place for taking care of her? Can she be please adjusted in the ICU there? Also, what wouldbe the cost per day?And who will be the pulmonary expert?
Doctor:
Hello,She requires ICU care as per the symptomatic details. Stephens is right place for her; you will get pulmonologist there to take care of the issue.She has to be shifted with ICU on wheels along with ventilator support. Cost there has to be inquired.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Bhagyesh V. Patel
