"Male, 51 years old. Apparently mute remote pathological history."
"The patient arrives on 23/3 at the emergency room of our hospital from Fabrizia (red zone of the province of Vibo Valentia) complaining of fever, important dyspnea from exertion and cough."
Oxygen saturation 90%; the blood gas analysis documents reduced pO2 values.
He is initially hospitalized in the Short-Covid Observation ward.
"Laboratory tests show increased values ​​of PRC, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, interleukin 6"
"On the computed/computerized tomography exam there are multiple pseudonodular parenchymal thickenings with ground glass with patchy distribution, mainly located in the mantle bilaterally, more evident in the lingual and basal left where they tend to confluence."
Minimal and initial thickening of the bilateral interlobular septa in the apical and basal site. The finding is compatible with viral interstitial disease.
The outcome of the swab confirms the positivity for Covid-19 infection.
"The patient is therefore transferred to the infectious diseases department of our hospital, where he is treated with antiviral therapy, Levoxacin and oxygen therapy (1.5 l / min). During hospitalization, type 2 diabetes is diagnosed."
"On 7/4, following the improvement of the clinical-laboratory picture, a new control computed/computerized tomography examination is performed"
"The thickenings that previously had a frosted glass character, now appear replaced by widespread fibrotic-like reticular bands which are associated with thickening of the small interstice (strip-like opacities)."
"These findings appear ubiquitously localized, but particularly evident in the bilateral mantle with distribution tending to confluence."
"These also appeared in the left apical site, where previously the pulmonary parenchyma appeared scarcely affected by the pathology."
"Two days later, the patient undergoes a pulmonary ultrasound, where the finding of B lines in the right apical site is documented."
"Although still positive for the swab, the patient is discharged the next day and monitored at home."
