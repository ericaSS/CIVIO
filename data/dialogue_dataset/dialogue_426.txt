Patient:
My 60 year old mother developed cough and sneezing .which medicine to be given?
Doctor:
In brief:   OTC medications.   You can use over the counter cough and cold medications.   Since covid-19 is endemic in your state you need to contact your mother's doctor and ask how to proceed. Her doctor may want her to be self quarantined and even be tested depending circumstances.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
