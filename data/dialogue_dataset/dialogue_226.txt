Doctor:
In brief:   Arrange testing   Stay home, provide fluids and ibuprofen after checking his temperature.   If he does not look well to you, please arrange a virtual or in person appointment with your pediatrician. Avoid contact with others, use good hand washing and consider testing for Influenza and Coronavirus.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
