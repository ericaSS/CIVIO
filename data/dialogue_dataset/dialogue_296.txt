Description
Is it true that if there was a lack of beds due to the virus, doctors would be less likely to save someone with diabetes, because they would be more likely to die??

Doctor:
In brief:   If you are dying   Everything is in motion and medical decisions are fluid, so you won't know until it happens.   That's because a healthy person under 50 won't die (has maybe half a percent chance of dying) from COVID-19, but a guy aged 70-80 has a 7-8% chance of dying from this... about the same as a non-elderly diabetic. That means the old guy and the diabetic both have about a 92-93% chance of NOT dying. (3/25/20)  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
