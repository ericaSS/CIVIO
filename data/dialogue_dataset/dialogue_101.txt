What causes short temperedness and headache while on treatment for pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I have pneumonia and I am on Levaquin with one day left on my cycle but i feel really crappy, tired, short tempered, headache, and my temperature is 97 do I have anything to worry about? Before taking the Levaquin my temperature was around 102.4 and normal for me is 98.6 on the money.
Doctor:
really crappy, tired, short tempered, headache are beacause of fever low grade and also pneumonia, evaluate yourself by CURB 65 score and pneumonia severity index and get you answer
