Doctor:
In brief:   Same as usual   During this COVID-19 pandemic, the other infections like colds, flus, and sinus infections can still happen.   The over-the-counter treatments have not changed. COVID-19 virus is so new that there has not been much verified research yet, so stick with what meds worked in the past. See the blog post...
