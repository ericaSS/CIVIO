"Figs. 1-2: Extended ground glass alteration in the LIS, with consolidative areas in the context. Smaller alteration with similar densitometric characteristics in the LID. Small ground glass areas in both upper lobes."
"Fig. 3: The alterations have a subpleural arrangement, more extended to the lower lobes."
"Fig. 4 Chest X-ray (AP in bed): We compare the chest X-ray examination, performed a few hours before the computed/computerized tomography scan. It is evident that the peripheral hypodiaphaly at the lower III of the left hemithorax is blurred. Data poorly correlated to computed/computerized tomography findings, by underestimation."
