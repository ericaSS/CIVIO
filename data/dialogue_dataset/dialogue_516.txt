Patient:

Doctor:
In brief:   Urgent Care!    You must go to an Urgent Care Center or Emergency Room as soon as possible to have an exam at which time lab tests & a chest X-ray should be ordered to help determine your diagnosis.   The sooner you are properly evaluated & treated the better! I wish you well with your health!   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
