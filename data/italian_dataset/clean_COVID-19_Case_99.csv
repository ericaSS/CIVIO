"Male, 75 years old."
"In APR: multiple micromolecular lambda myeloma during hematological follow-up (in therapy with carfilzomib, thirteenth cycle, last administration 13/03/20); carotid atheromasia."
"At home with: Aciclovir 400 milligram x 2, acetylsalicylic acid 100 milligram, cholecalciferol."
"03/28/2020 Conducted in pulmonary stenosis for fever for about 3 days and dry cough, which was later associated with dyspnea and episode of night desaturation (89% in aa). Contact with a suspected case of Covid19. In pulmonary stenosis have been performed:"
Chest X-ray (AP supine):
Blocks of parenchymal thickening in bilateral mid-basal region compatible with interstitial pneumonia.
"EE: trilinear cytopenia, only lymphopenia is marked (540 / mmc). Altered inflammation indexes (in particular ferritin 5723 microgram / L, polymerase chain reaction 59 milligram / L). Fibrinogen 5.36 g / L. Creatinine 1.65 milligram / deciliter Mild hypoalbuminemia (32.8 g / L). EGA: pO 2 62 mmHg in of each, equal parts"
SARS-CoV-2 buffer: positive .
03/29/2020 The Patient is transferred to the Covid Department to manage dyspnea.
"To the objective evaluation performed upon entering the ward: Watchful patient, fairly oriented but slowed down. PAS 145 mmHg, FC 80 beats per minute rhythmic, oxygen saturation 94% in of each, equal parts with FR 24 apm, TC 38 Â° C. No abdominal acuities, no declining edemas, nor clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis"
Therapy with Lopinavir / Ritonavir + hydroxychloroquine is set.
Worsening chest x-ray.
03/04/2020 At echocardioscopy at the patient's bed there is a fairly large floating formation in the right atrium.
Heparin therapy set.
"04/04/2020 At the EO, the lower limbs show dyschromias of the left foot, with a marbled appearance, and alteration of the thermotact of the left foot (colder than the right), scarcely appreciable pedidio pulse, reduction of the capillary refill."
05/04/2020 Performs angio-CT pulmonary circulation:
endoluminal filling defect at the level of the main branch for the lower lobe of the left pulmonary artery and its subdivision branches.
"Widespread ground glass thickening throughout the lung area, with prevalent peripheral distribution. In bilateral basal site, concomitant thickening of the interlobular septa with a more compact aspect of the thickening (picture compatible with viral pneumonia)."
"05/04/2020 He simultaneously performs angio-CT aorta and lower limbs. Pervia and regular caliber left common iliac artery. The middle tract of the external iliac artery is not contrasted, with parietal calcifications, revascularized in its distal tract."
The lumen of the superficial femoral artery is filiform. The deep femoral artery from the middle III is not opaque.
The popliteal artery is almost completely occluded. The lumen of the anterior tibial artery up to the proximal III is filiform. Do not contrast the remaining arterial branches of the leg and foot.
"Asymmetrical representation of the venous district of the lower limbs, not contrasted on the left. There are also some hypodense areas in the spleen and liver with peripheral distribution ."
"Indication is given for indicated surgery of embolectomy of the left iliac axis with Fogarty catheter, performed on the same day. After the operation, the progression of the gangrene framework of the lower left limb is indicated. Bleeding from arterial access with thrombocytopenia and need for blood transfusion appeared."
"09/04/2020 Stable parameters are found in the haematological consultation. Acute ischemia of the lower limb is not referable to the patient's basic hematological pathology or to his treatment, considering the stationarity of the detected hematological parameters."
"The case we have presented highlights the tendency for an increased thrombophilic risk of some patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, with the development of pulmonary embolism and acute ischemia of the lower limbs on a thrombotic basis."
