Doctor:
No. Don't go to work you could unknowinly spread the virus. We are all effectively on lock down and the sooner the better if you THINK you have it stay home, if you ave access to testing then get tested BUT we are running out of tests (to my knowledge) if you deteriorate send a message here and I will advise. DO not go to work.
