Description
Hi, I would like to know where to get tested for Covid-19, I work in a call center and one agent was confirmed to have tested positive and I still had contact with her close friends and her last Wednesday before I sent her to the doctor for a check?

Doctor:
Self-quarantine. Try self-quarantine for 14 days; call your health care provider if you start having symptoms to get instructions regarding testing, self-quarantine and possible hospitalization then follow through!
