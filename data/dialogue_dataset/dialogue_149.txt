Suggest treatment for pneumonia

Dialogue
Patient:
my cousin was admitted yesterday for pneumonia and a collasped lung which was diagnoised yesterday. they did surgery this morning by cleaning out and draining fluids. she is now heavily sadated with a tube in her right lung. what will it take for her to get well again?
Doctor:
It sound like your cousin has something called- Empyema. It is basically an abscess in the chest cavity. And the correct treatment for it is drainage - which was done appropriatley. But he should receive antibiotic treatment with coverage of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Usually specimens are send from the procedure to see which organisms grow and provide a more directed antibiotic coverage.
