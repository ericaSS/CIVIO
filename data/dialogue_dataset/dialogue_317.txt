Doctor:
In brief:   Covid 19   The incubation period of covid 19 is 2-14 days and you're past that.   However if fever, chills, heavier cough, or breathing difficulties develop, call your MD for instructions. For now, drink adequate fluids, gargle with warm salt water. I recommend also using zinc lozenges and take acetaminophen. Don't infect others regardless of what type of infection you have.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
