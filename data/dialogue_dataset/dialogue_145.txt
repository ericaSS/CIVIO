What causes recurrent cough despite taking antibiotics for pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
Hi- I was diagnosed a month ago with community pneumonia. After two rounds of antibiotics I was feeling better. Now my cough is back and I have a strange heavy feeling especially in my legs. I have been exhausted too for the last few days. Could this be from pneumonia?
Doctor:
Hello! Just because you have previously had a pneumonia does not necessarily mean this time too You will be having it again. Since how long have you been having cough ? Are you having a dry cough or produce phlegm ? what's the colour of the phlegm ? last time you had pneumonia was it properly n completely treated ? Apart from cough what are your other complaints at present ? your cough can be due to inflammation of your throat lining or it can be something to do with your lungs like previous time.  Kindly get your checked by a physician with an open mind and go for a Chest X ray if necessary.
