Patient:

Doctor:
In brief:   Eye pain   Eye pain can be for various reasons.    Bilateral eye pain would be less likely foreign body although dusts can cause this. Conjunctivitis can be bilateral from either bacteria, virus or allergies. Light exposure can cause eye irritation.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
