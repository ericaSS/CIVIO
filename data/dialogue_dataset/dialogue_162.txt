What causes chest pain and cramps after treating pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I was recently released from hospital, I had pneumonia. After 1 week, I have finished the oral antibiotics. 2 days later, the sweats have returned (no temperature) and I am feeling generally unwell. I saw my doctor y day and I had another x-ray. My doctor rang to say there is no change but didn t recommend I do anything different. I have continued my physiotherapy to bring up whatever is in my lungs. The cramping I am now experiencing is excruciatingly painful. I just don t know what to do next. I live in a remote area and accessing a doctor or hospital is difficult. Please help.
Doctor:
Respected user, hi I evaluated your query thoroughly.* What is meant by '' there is no change'' in x-ray ? mean to convey that    the pneumonia is as it is in x-ray as before treatment ?   then in that case it is non-responsive treatment.* In addition to that your symptoms also show that you are not alright to    much extent .* Chest pain & cramps are in relation with underlying pneumonia, you are   telling that treatment is over but no it is not finished.@ Recommend to consult with all details of scanned reports , treatment     taken  till now , so that we can study the case in detail & make guidelines     for further perfect recovery .Hope this helps you.Welcome for any further assistance.Thanks for using Healthcaremagic.com & reviewing my answer thoroughly.Wishing you fine recovery from the same.Regards dear take care.
