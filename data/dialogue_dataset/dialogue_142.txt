Can pneumonia affect lung function?

Dialogue
Patient:
Good day,
My son, who is 4 yrs old, has been diagnosed with lobar pneumonia and is now hospitalised.  This is about his 6th or 7th infection.  He had a double aortic arch that led to the entrance of his right lung and his trachea and esophagus being squeezed. He is now diagnosed with asthma.  Can the pneumonia deplete his lung function over time? What, if anything, can I do to reduce the number of infections?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Yes, recurrent lung infections can directly diminish lung functions.Recurrent infections can also cause asthma, bronchitis and further deteriorate lung functions.Best way to prevent respiratory tract infection is vaccines.Give him pneumococcal and influenza vaccines.These vaccines will provide 80% protection. Give him fruits, multivitamin tablets and protein powder for high immunity.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.
