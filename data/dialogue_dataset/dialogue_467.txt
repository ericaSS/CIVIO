Description
Hpv virus has affected my sex life. I bleed a lot during sex and on my period. I did a cervical cauterisation but my period is still the same and I’m scared to have sex due to bleeding as I was once hospitalised for it. Any tips on what I can do?

Doctor:
In brief:   Cervix trauma   One technique is to have your partner only penetrate your vagina half way to avoid trauma to the cervix.   You and your partner can still have enough stimulation and pleasure this way.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
