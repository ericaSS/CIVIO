"Axial images, reconstruction with Lung algorithm"
"Multiple bilateral parenchymal thickenings, with irregular margins, some with patent air bronchogram and others with frosted glass, associated with intra- and inter-lobular septal thickening, with a prevalent peribroncovasal and subpleural distribution and with subtotal commitment of the lower lobes, in particular of the LID ; thin fibrotic streak of LIS."
"Coronal reconstruction, reconstruction with Lung algorithm"
"Bilaterally, multiple parenchymal thickenings, some with patent air bronchogram and others with frosted glass, with a prevalent peribroncovasal and subpleural distribution and greater level of the lower lobes, in particular of the LID."
