Description
Could the persistent strep inspite of using Amoxicillin be due to pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
Son is 9 years old.  He has strep and is on amoxicilin.  His fever is gone now, but he still doesn't feel good.  Very tired and dark circles under the eyes.  Very pale.  He has been on the med for 3 full days and I think the antibiotic is not working.  Could he also have pneumonia (no cough though).
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.No need to worry for pneumonia as he is not having coughing.Coughing is first symptom of pneumonia.So pneumonia is unlikely in the absence of coughing.And 3 days antibiotic duration is too early to decide about effectiveness.You should give full 7 days course of amoxicillin.Fever was subsided so amoxicillin Island definitely working.Along within amoxicillin, give him plenty of fluids orally, fruits, juices etc for energy.Don't worry, he will be alright.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
