Suggest treatment for pneumonia

Dialogue
Patient:
My sister has recently had a bone marrow transplant. In June she had a lung infection and since has had breathing problems. She has just been readmitted and a scan showed pneumonia, pus and fluid has been drained and further tests have shown she has a fistula? If this is treated will her breathing problems be eased?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Yes, if we treat Fistula, drain pus and fluid and cure pneumonia, her breathing will be eased.Since she is bone marrow transplant patient, possibility of atypical bacterial infection is more likely because of immunosuppression.So get done bronchoscopy and BAL culture. Also get done fluid culture and sensitivity report. Culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. By these, we can achieve faster recovery. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your sister. Thanks.
