Doctor:
Not particularly . The muscles involved in coughing & vomiting are similar & young children often have difficulty not vomiting if they cough hard enough. I would concentrate of maintaining her fluid balance & see if she gradually improves. These are often simple viruses but need to be monitored closely.
