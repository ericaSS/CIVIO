"Male patient, 83 years old, ex-smoker with a history of pathological history positive for arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, IPB. Not reported contacts with SAR-CoV2 positive patients."
He arrives in pulmonary stenosis for cough and fever for 3 days with a peak of 38.9 °.
"Saturation 92% with 02 2 L / minute, no leukopenia, slight increase in polymerase chain reaction, lactate dehydrogenase and transaminases."
"Thoracic ultrasound is performed in the pulmonary stenosis regime which shows posterior bilateral interstitial engagement, at the bases, alveolar consolidation area with air bronchograms and moderate concomitant pleural effusion."
Chest x-ray is therefore performed in a single appendectomy projection in supine decubitus position
The X-ray examination shows nuanced parenchymal thickening in the middle and lower field
in the right hemithorax and in the middle field on the left.
It was decided to perform the immediate computed/computerized tomography scan of the chest without administration of contrast medium.
"The computed/computerized tomography examination shows multiple frosted glass areoles with greater peripheral and parascissural distribution tending towards confluence, with initial consolidation phenomena, in the context of which there is a thickening of the mainly intralobular interstice with crazy paving aspects."
Concomitant center-panlobular emphysematous changes.
Oropharyngeal swab is tested which is positive for SAR-CoV-2
"After 3 days of hospitalization, measurement of the D-dimer was performed, as a screening for the start of therapy with Tolicizumab, with very high values ​​(17234 micrograms / ml) ."
"At the same time, the patient showed a worsening of the respiratory picture."
It is decided to perform an angio-CT examination of the pulmonary circulation in the suspicion of pulmonary embolism.
computed/computerized tomography angiography of the pulmonary circulation shows opacification defects affecting segmental-subsegmentary arterial branches for both basal pyramids (white arrows). The
parenchymal commitment is comparable to the previous computed/computerized tomography examination.
The case just discussed aims to highlight the increased risk of developing pulmonary embolism in SAR-Cov-2 viral infection pneumonia patients.
"In the case of very high D-dimer values ​​during infection, a computed/computerized tomography scan of the pulmonary circulation is useful in confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism."
