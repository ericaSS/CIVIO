Doctor:
In brief:   Anxiety   Your anxiety is overall justified, given massive social tension mounted by the pandemic.   Depending on local resources and through your doc's office, you may benefit from counseling from a clinical psychologist via telemedicine in order to avoid exposure during lockdown. Use this time to connect to your loved ones remotely ( Skype, phone, etc) and talk about your worries.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
