How can walking pneumonia be prevented?

Dialogue
Patient:
I have been recently diagnosed w the flu (nose swab test done). I am 34 years old- ex-smoker (quit completely for 7 years now) however each year I get "walking pneumonia" at least once. I'm almost certain I've got it again now. Anything I can do to stop getting pneumonia??

Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated.2. Do steam inhalation and warm water gargles 5-6 times a day.3. Take pneumococcal and influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccine should be taken annually while pneumococcal every five yearly.4. Avoid smoke, dust, fumes, chemicals etc and wear mask.5. Avoid unnecessary hospital visits.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
