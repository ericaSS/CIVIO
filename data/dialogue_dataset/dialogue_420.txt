Doctor:
Possible. Top symptoms include fever, dry cough and SOB. An obvious possibility.  If so, your best step is to self-quarntine. Remember at your age low risk of complication and typically will pass without issue. If worsening SOB be seen. Call your provider or check with local health department.
