Doctor:
In brief:   Many possibilities.   Most people get a headache at some time, such as from colds, infections (usually viruses or sinusitis), lack of sleep, too much driving, long hours on the computer, stress at work, etc.  ..  A bad or severe headache, increasing headache, recurrent headache, weird headache, or one with other worrisome symptoms should be checked by one's primary care doctor or the ER. Can call one's Dr. first to chat.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
