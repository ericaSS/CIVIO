Doctor:
In brief:   Minimal outside time   To avoid spread of COVID-19, use precautions such as staying home as much as possible Avoid contact with others until the infection rate begins to decline.   Monitor your temperature, rest and drink fluids. On day 7 post contact if you have no symptoms, most likely you are fine. Continue to use good hand washing and keep surfaces clean.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
