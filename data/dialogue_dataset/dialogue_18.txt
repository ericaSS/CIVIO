Description
I am getting headache at night. Been battling with a sore throat and post nasal drip. No fever. Cough only slightly at times. I went for laproscope and removal of my fallopian tubes on 2nd March. All this started after that. Must i test for covid 1o?

Doctor:
In brief: Unlikely
Not at this point.
Treat what you have currently symptomatically. Stock up now whilst not yet on lockdown. I don't feel that you qualify for a Covid test right now. Keep posting your questions.
