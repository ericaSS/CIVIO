Can pneumonia cause itching in upper torso?

Dialogue
Patient:
My daughter is 11 years old she has has pneumonia she has been sick since January 3rd symptoms keep changing. she is up at night itching all over her upper torso, head, and ears. She has major headache and abdominal pain.. she is very upset and crying because this is going on way to long and she has seen many doctors with no relief any suggestions. Tried most itching products what could be causing the head pain and stomach pain. they check her today for appendicitis
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 According to the history it might be a viral situation or an allergy.  Don't worry so much she is under medical control.
