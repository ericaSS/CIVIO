Dialogue
Patient:
Will my  mask from Sherwin Williams paint store with filters protect me from corona virus along with paint fumes?
Doctor:
In brief:   Maybe   Such a mask helps protect others from any respiratory material you exhale or cough but does not filter out the virus.   Only high end medical & industrial masks (P95/N95)would filter that. Your best protection is frequent hand washing and not touching your face/mouth/nose with contaminated fingers.,  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
