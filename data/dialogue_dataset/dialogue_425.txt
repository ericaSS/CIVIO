Description
I am very fearful of the Corona virus, if I have a dry cough and headache should I stay indoors and away from others?

Dialogue
Patient:
I am very fearful of the Corona virus, if I have a dry cough and headache should I stay indoors and away from others?
Doctor:
In brief:   Self quarantine.   Isolate yourself and contact to your doctor by phone or via internet.   You may have flu more than corona virus. Because headache is not a common symptom of the corona virus and your age is not the age that is vulnarable to corona virus.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
