Description
I have shortness of breath and are worried, I don’t have a cough or sore throat, so they will not test me, should I do a private test?

Doctor:
Shortness of breath. Covid testing is hard to come by. At 37 you are in a lower risk group.  And I doubt you could get a test. Keep isolated for two weeks. I know we have been ordering tests through HealthTap, but that does not lead to getting the test done, due to shortages. (3/21/20)
