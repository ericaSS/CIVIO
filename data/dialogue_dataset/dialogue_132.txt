Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Constant coughing and hypothermia (low body temperature) in pneumonia patient can be due to1. Worsening of underlying pneumonia2. BronchitisSo better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).Yoi may need higher antibiotic and inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
