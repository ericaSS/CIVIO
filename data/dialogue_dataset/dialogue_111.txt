Dialogue
Patient:
my boyfriend was put in the hospital for strep a nemonia 5 days ago yesterday they done another x ray and said that his nemonia was getting worse and had spread to his left lung and was also in his right real bad they also done a culture on the stuff that hes been coughing up out of his lungs and today they told us he has staph in his lungs how dangerous is this and what should be done
Doctor:
Hello Thank you for trusting HCM Dear what is the culture report suggestive?? Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia take more time to come under control, usually community acquired Staphylococcus infection may present with methicillne resistance(MRSA) , for this patient cases need to treated with vancomycine, and linezolid. Some patients also developed vancomycine resistant staph aureus (VRSA) infection, this infection very problematic to control. very few drugs like Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid available to control VRSA. Please follow your doctor orders they will treat you in right way. I think I answered to your question if you have more questions please feel free to ask.
