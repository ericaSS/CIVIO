Doctor:
In brief:   Doctor can examine   Throat symptoms can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics are needed), a cold or influenza, or from some other cause such as allergies, irritants, or acid reflux.   Usually, one sees the doctor if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go quickly (mainly to check for strep throat). During this COVID-19 pandemic, doctors want patients to call by video or phone first. (3/25/20)  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
