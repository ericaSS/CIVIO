What do hurting ribs radiating to back and shoulder after being treated for pneumonia mean?

Dialogue
Patient:
Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...I have been to the doctor 2 times. First time, it was a severe sinus infection, week later had to go back, turned into pneumonia, had to go back third time. All 3 times I was given a shot, antibotics & c-pack first time, steroids, antibotics & shot second and antibotics & shot third. I have been hurting under my ribs and has gone to my back and shoulder. Do you think the pneumonia has gotten worse? Do I need to go back to the doctor?
