Description
I'm a healthcare worker, seeing walk-in patients and working in emergency department. I have a severe case of flu-like symptoms but no confirmed contact with known covid patients. Do my symptoms warrant testing or should I risk spreading my disease?

Doctor:
Sounds like viral. Sounds viral but not corona however healthcare workers are high risk by being exposed to ill populations. I would stay home so that you do not cross infect. If you have access to a test then get that self isolate and monitor your symptoms. Post on here if confused. .
