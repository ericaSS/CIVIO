"Female patient, 48 years old. Remote pathological history changes. The patient is a resident of Fabrizia, the red zone of the province of Vibo Valentia. He arrives in pulmonary stenosis in Serra San Bruno on 5/4 with fever, dyspnoea, diarrhea and mild headache. Laboratory tests, saturation and blood gas analysis within the limits of the norm."
A computed/computerized tomography examination is required in Covid-19 clinical-anamnestic suspicion.
The examination demonstrates an extensive frosted glass thickening involving part of the anterior segment of the upper lobe and part of the medial segment of the middle lobe. On the left there is only a limited subpleural thickening in the lateral segment of the lower lobe (arrow). The finding appears to be attributable to an atypical form of viral pneumonia.
"The swab confirms the positivity for Covid-19. She is admitted to the Infectious Diseases department of the orally “G. Jazzolino ”in Vibo Valentia, where it is treated by antiviral therapy, Levoxacin and antidiarrheal drugs. On 18/4 pulmonary ultrasound examination is performed, negative."
"On the same day, the patient was discharged for the improvement of the clinical picture. The case just exposed demonstrates the extreme variability of both clinical-laboratory and tomodensitometric manifestations of Covid-19 pathology. In the specific case, it is a rare manifestation of the distribution of parenchymal alterations, asymmetric and almost unilateral."
