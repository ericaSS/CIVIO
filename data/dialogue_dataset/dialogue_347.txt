Description
I have been in frequent close contact with tourists (including people from the USA and Germany), doing gin tastings. I have a cough for the past two weeks, should I get tested for Covid19 as a safety precaution?

Doctor:
Avoid contact. Stay at home for at least 7 days from the onset or symptoms, or for at least three days following fever whichever is longer in duration. Cover your cough, monitor your temperature. Watch for signs of worsening including fever, shortness of breath or worsening cough.
