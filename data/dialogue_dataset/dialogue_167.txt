What does coughing up of clear phlegm indicate while treating pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I was diagnosed with pneumonia 2 days ago at med express and was given a prescription for levoquin. I cough up clear phlegm. My research tells me I m being treated for bacterial pneumonia but the clear phlegm ,Indicates viral pneumonia. I m a 67 year old male who quit smoking last November.
Doctor:
Hello sir,Seeing at your history would like to know more about your case.Want to look at your chest x ray first.and if its definitely diagnosed pnemonia, then in case you could be right that it could be viral pneumonia.but you can't stamp it as viral from clear phlegm. Get done white blood counts which will be within normal limits in case of viral and high in case of bacterial pneumonia. Also get done Procalcitonin and CRP level of your blood. it will give you final idea.And as you were smoker phlegm might be due to Bronchiectesis or COPD. rule out that.
