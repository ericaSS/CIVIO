"61-year-old female cardiac, hypertensive and diabetic patient being treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents. The patient is a resident of Fabrizia, the red zone of the province of Vibo Valentia. Pathological case history positive for contact with Covid-19 patient: the sister, in fact, is the patient already exposed in the clinical case n."
"For this reason, the patient is subjected to gold- and nasopharyngeal swab, positive for Covid-19. On 10/4, the patient is transported via 118 to the pulmonary stenosis of Serra San Bruno for the onset of an important tickling cough, fever (37.3 Â°) and diarrhea. Laboratory tests do not show significant alterations, with the exception of hyperglycaemia related to known diabetes. Saturation and blood gas analysis within the limits of the norm."
The HRTC exam
"documents some parenchymal thickenings with ground glass with prevalent patchy subpleural distribution (fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10), more numerous on the left (anterior and posterior segment of the upper lobe, lingula, lateral segment of the lower lobe) than on the right (lateral segment of the middle and, pseudonodular, in the lateral basal segment of the lower lobe)."
"In the reconstructions with filter for mediastinum (fig. 7, 8, 9, 11) several lymphadenopathies in the upper and prevascular vascular paratracheal area are also detectable, the largest of which has a short axis of about 17 millimeter and causes compression on the adjacent lung parenchyma (anterior segment of the upper left lobe, fig. 10, arrow ). Another more limited lymphadenopathy is documented in the lower paracaval site."
"The patient is admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of the Jazzolino orally in Vibo Valentia, where she is treated with antiviral therapy, levofloxacin and lactic ferments. For the improvement of the clinical conditions, the patient (negative to the swab) is discharged on 25/4."
"The above case represents a rare manifestation of Covid-19 pathology: according to Shi H. et al, only 6% of patients with Coronavirus infection have mediastinal lymphadenomegalies. 1 It has also been hypothesized that this finding may be related to the severity of the disease, being more frequent in intensive care unit patients. 2,3 However, the case presented here in consideration of the clinical course is not one of the latter."
