Doctor:
Self quarentine. The current NICD and department of health guidelines are to self isolate for 14 days. If you develop fever, cough or shortness of breath contact your primary care provider and arrange for testing. For more info Whatsapp the word "Hi" to excellent  department of health hot-line 0600 123456. .
