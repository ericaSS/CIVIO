Patient:
Where can I get tested for Corona if I am in the rondebosch area?
Doctor:
In brief:   Consult with your GP   You cannot just request a COVID19 test, without fulfilling certain official SA testing criteria, even if you are a private patient and are willing to pay cash.  If you meet the strict testing criteria,then your GP will need to complete a request form  and tell you where to go.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
