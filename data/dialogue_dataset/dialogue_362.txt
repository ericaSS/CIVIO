Description
I have a slight cough over the last few days but haven't been exposed to people or traveled to covid 19 areas. I have recently quit smoking so could that be it. What should I do?

Doctor:
Keep non smoking. If you have no exposure history to COVID 19, your cough is probably not infection. keep up the good work and do not smoke or vape.
