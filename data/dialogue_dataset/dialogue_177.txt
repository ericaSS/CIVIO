Doctor:
In brief:   It depends.   It depends of your country and the state of coronavirus, in some places you need to have traveled recently to another country to get the test, and in another countrys you need to be tested right away after any symptoms.   You should check your country  phase of coronavirus  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
