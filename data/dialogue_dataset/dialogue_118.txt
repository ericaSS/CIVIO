What is the treatment for pneumonia and bronchitis?

Dialogue
Patient:
I have been sick for five weeks, I had pneumonia or bronchitis my doctor said.  Three weeks later I wasn't better so I went to doctor and had spatum test and she said I had significant ammounts of strep in my spatum.  I have chest pains and burning in my lungs, dizziness, caughing and a lot of mucus. I don't really understand what strep is and if this is serious
Doctor:
Step short form for Streptococcus pneumonia. It is a microorganism which causes pneumonia or infection. With antibiotics it should get treated. It can be serious if not treated.
