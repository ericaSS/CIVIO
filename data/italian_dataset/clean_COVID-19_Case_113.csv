"Female patient, 90 years old, in RSA, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension and diffuse multi-district calcific parietal atheromasia."
"He had been experiencing shortness of breath, dry cough and fever (38 ° C) for several days."
EO: mitral valve reduced in both lung areas.
Saturation O2: 88%.
"ECG: BBsin, in the absence of ECGgraphic disorders indicative of ischemia."
Negative history of certain contact with known positive Covid-19 patients.
"Laboratory tests: Leukopenia. Anemia. Increase in polymerase chain reaction, lactate dehydrogenase and procalcitonin values. The D-Dimer and troponin values ​​were within the limits."
"A chest computed/computerized tomography study with high resolution algorithm (HRCT), with 64Multislices equipment, whose images obtained have been analyzed with 1.2 millimeter slice-thickness and subsequent MPR reconstructions, is performed in urgency and in basal conditions."
"There was documented the presence of a nuanced thickening / parenchymal consolidation plate in the basal posterior posterior left. Other small and nuanced parenchymal thickenings, with a frosted glass appearance, were identifiable in the middle-basal lung fields on the right. Fine background grinding of lung density, bilaterally, with more evidence on the left."
Presence of bilateral basal fibrotic-disventilatory streaks. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease signs.
"There is no evidence of pleuro-pericardial effusion. Enlarged cardiac image. Scoliotic course of the descending thoracic aorta, with widespread aorto-coronary atheromatous calcifications."
"A severe and suggestive finding of spondyloarthrosis was also identifiable, with alteration of the normal architecture of the spine, scoliotic and with evident dorsal hump."
"The SARS-CoV-2 swab tested positive. Therefore, the patient was admitted to the UOC of Infectious Diseases of our Hospital, Covid HUB of reference for the entire province of Reggio Calabria, promptly establishing multi-drug therapy and O2-therapy, also in consideration of the various pathologies suffered by the patient ( of which, in anamnesis)."
"Six days after admission, his clinical condition deteriorated despite the treatment. Laboratory tests still showed elevated inflammation and procalcitonin indices, anemia and alteration of serum electrolytes (especially Na-K)."
"A thorax X-ray examination was performed (in the seventh day) in the patient's bed (in supine decubitus) in the ward, which documented a worsening of the radiological findings. Increased parenchymal thickening in the right middle-basal site, with widespread reticular thickening of the interstitial peri-bronchovasal weft. Appearance of bi-basal pleural effusion (more evident on the right), with obliteration of the related costophrenic sinuses. The congestions and thickened. Enlarged cardiac image. Widening of the mediastinal profile."
"In the following days the patient remained stable, although the radiological picture still had not normalized and the swabs were still positive. The case presented highlights the usefulness of HRCT in the study of interstitial Covid-19 pneumonia even in the initial stages of the disease, given the high sensitivity of the method, especially in patients who have other concomitant pathologies and particular anatomical conditions (which are difficult for the urgent execution of the traditional X-ray investigation, as the first method)."
