Description
Why does HIV RNA appear in blood earlier than its antigens and not together?

Dialogue
Patient:
Why does HIV RNA appear in blood earlier than its antigens and not together?
Doctor:
Viral physiology. HIV is a virus that exists to replicate and increase its numbers, primarily, it’s just how the virus functions, prioritizes replication over other functions. I’m sure there is more complex immunologic answer from a specialist in infectious diseases.
