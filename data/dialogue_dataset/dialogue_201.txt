Doctor:
In brief:   Most likely not c   Most likely sinusitis or seasonal allergy.   Try to access a telelphonic or virtual consult to discuss thoroughly with someone. For now stay home stay safe. Treat yourself and all in your family as if they have covid for now =it's safer.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
