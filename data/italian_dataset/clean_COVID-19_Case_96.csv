45-year-old woman transferred from another hospital with an already positive SARS-CoV-2 buffer.
"Patient currently apiretic, hemodynamically stable, slightly dyspnoic, Sat oxygen 92%."
"Bilaterally there are some patches of parenchymal thickening with a frosted glass appearance, with a predominantly subpleural distribution. Multiple areas of bilateral parenchymal consolidation concomitantly, in particular at the level of the dorsal segment of the right upper lobe and at the postero-basal parenchyma of both lower lobes."
"Absence of pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. It should also be noted the presence of three solid nodular formations, the largest of which (10 mm) is located in the latero-basal segment of the lower left lobe."
The computed/computerized tomography control shows a reduction in the number and extent of the previously reported parenchymal thickening areas. Parenchymal consolidation bands remain available bilaterally subpleurally.
