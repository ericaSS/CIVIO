Description
My 68 yr old mom is waiting for corona virus results. She’s been having fever 101-102 for a week. Was admitted to hospital and has pneumonia. How is it treated and should she stay at the hospital until her symptoms get better? She has HTN. Help!

Doctor:
COVID-19? It sounds like your mom is in good hands. If she has COVID, they will know how to treat it. If the pneumonia is beleived to be bacterial, they will treat with antibiotics. There is no proved effective treatment for coronavirus itself. Ask her doctors if she is a candidate for remdesivir -- not proved effective but sometimes available on a "compassionate" basis for severely ill patients. Good luck.
