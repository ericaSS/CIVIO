What causes pneumonia while using CPAP machine?

Dialogue
Patient:
I have been using CPAP machine for a year on pressure 6 with a nasal pillow mask.  I have never had pneumonia in my life.  I am 52 years old and just got my first case of pneumonia (discovered by a CAT scan).  Could the CPAP machine be responsible for causing my pneumonia.  They also found a small 3mm nodule.
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Yes, CPAP machine if not properly maintained can cause pneumonia. Actually, there are a lot of things in CPAP machine that can be infected.Things like tubing, mask, and filters etcetera are very prone to infection. So, proper care should be taken to prevent infections from these parts.Better to ask CPAP provider to check all these parts and if infected replace them.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar
