Dialogue
Patient:
I have a dry cough and sore throat. Should I be scared of contacting of Covid 19?
Doctor:
No. Fear does not help us right now. This thing is coming. Angela Merkel said 70% of us will get it. Rather stay isolated and access your doctor via a telephonic consult and keep drinking fluids and also boost your immunity.
