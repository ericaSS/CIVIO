Doctor:
In brief:   Not enough tests   Aside from really sick people and hospitalized patients, there aren't enough PCR viral tests in the US.   For now, we tell people that if they are healthy, just keep 6 feet from other people, and remember that high-touch objects have viruses. If people have any symptoms, even just sniffles, they isolate themselves, and call their doctors if having moderate or worsening symptoms.
