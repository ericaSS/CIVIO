Patient:

Doctor:
In brief:   Telephonic consult?   Could well be another respiratory virus, I would stay home for now.   Use this platform to consult either virtually or ask more questions. Use home medicine - decongestant and pain medication. STay away from any anti-inflammatories if possible. Keep up warm fluids.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
