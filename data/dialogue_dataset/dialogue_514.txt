I need to check if I have COVID-19?

Dialogue
Patient:
I need to check if I have COVID-19?
Doctor:
In brief:   Call a doctor   Most places require a doctor to order this, but check into your local healthcare services to see if there is way for you to be tested without that, good luck.   There are criteria in most places to qualify for testing, so look into that to see if you qualify, ask your doctor...  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
