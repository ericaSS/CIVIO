Is persistent coughing sign of pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I had a fever from Friday to yesterday (Sunday), along with a cough. The temperature is now gone, but my cough is still here. I have been clearing my throat for a couple of weeks, but the coughing part started I believe on Saturday. Today, the cough is breaking, and other then the cough I feel 100% fine. Do I have pneumonia?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Possibility of pneumonia is very less because you are not having chest pain, mucus expectoration and your fever is also gone.So drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Avoid oily and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid hard to chew food. Take levocetrizine and paracetamol combination twice daily. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation 4-5 times a day. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
