Re: COVID-19 -- Is it safe to go out in public without a face mask on right now as long as the recommended 6ft distance is maintained? Am wondering if picking up groceries curbside (have to get out of car and open trunk for store employee) is safe?

Doctor:
In brief:   Yes and no.   Yes for the first question.   For the second question i should say no because the possibility of the store employee coming close less than 6 feet is great. But what you can do is you get out of the car open the truck and then call the store employee for a curb side pick up leaving always a 6 feet distance between two of you.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
