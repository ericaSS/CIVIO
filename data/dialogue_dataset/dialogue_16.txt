Doctor:
Symptoms of COVID-19 are usually the same as a cold or the flu, with diarrhea being uncommon.
The COVID-19 infection is worldwide. The goal is to keep people separated so that the clinics and hospitals are not overwhelmed. Patients with medical symptoms should see their primary care doctor on VIDEO or by PHONE, and get instructed to go to a clinic or ER only if not treatable by video or phone.
