Description
Hi. I am a 25 yr healthy, final year medical student. On Fri (20th) I developed symptoms: continuous dry cough, headache, a very very sore throat, sore neck and back muscles, and tired. I am now improving. Should I be tested for COVID19?

Doctor:
Self isolate. Current NICD/DOH guidelines are to self isolate. If getting worse (fever, cough and shortness of breath), or if you have traveled or been in contact with anyone with confirmed COVID 19, arrange for testing. For more info try whatsapp "Hi" to 0600123456 (the DOH covid hotline)
