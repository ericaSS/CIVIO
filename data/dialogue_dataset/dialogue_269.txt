Description
My 18 month old woke up from her nap this afternoon sounding hoarse. Is this reason for alarm given the current Corona situation?

Doctor:
In brief:   No    Kids are very resilient and the best fighters of this.   Stay home and stay safe. People spread this virus. Your baby will be fine, I don't think hoarseness is corona at all :) keep asking questions as you need to  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
