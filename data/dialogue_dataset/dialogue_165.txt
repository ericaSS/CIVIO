What causes pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
my daughter was thought to have pneomonia back in sept.  after several courses of antibiotics and ct scans they found a spot on both lungs that was growing and the pet scan showed a spot on the brain.  lung biopsy was inconclusive.  Dr.s beginning thought before biopsy was bacterial infection.  Is it likely something like this would go to the brain
Doctor:
Respected user, hi it is unlikely to disseminate lung pathology to brain in your case.It may be existing condition in brain detected afterwards or occurrence with/ after the lung pathology.Hope this clears your query.Thanks for using Health care magic & giving me an opportunity to assist you.Regards dear take care.
