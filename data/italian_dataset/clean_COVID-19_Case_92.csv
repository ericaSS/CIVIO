"We report the case studies of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who have come to the observation of the emergency department of our facility, which evaluates pediatric patients, extending the assessment age up to the 18th year of life."
"Patients with access to the emergency room for suspected symptoms, who tested positive for the nasopharyngeal swab, were 12, 5 of them underwent a chest X-ray, nobody was required to perform HRCT."
CASE 1
5-week-old male infant with 2-day fever-conjunctivitis and rhinitis.
"At the entrance: 100% oxygen saturation, normal blood tests."
Test positive for the nose and throat swab mother and grandmother.
"Chest X-ray: examination performed in appendectomy projection, in supine patient"
accentuation of the interstitial weft in the lower right paracardiac and left paracardiac.
CASE 2
"Patient discharged in good condition, in fiduciary home isolation after 3 days."
"2. Teenager, female, 17 years old with fever and diarrhea, nonproductive tickling cough and asthenia."
"At the entrance: 100% oxygen saturation, blood chemistry tests with slightly increased polymerase chain reaction"
Chemical industry employee with positive nose-pharyngeal swab cases.
"Chest X-ray: examination performed in appendectomy projection, on a supine patient"
no parenchymal thickenings nor signs of spillage.
"Patient discharged in good condition, in fiduciary home isolation."
CASE 3
"13-year-old male teenager with neurological pathology and ulcerative rectal colitis, with fever for several days, pharyngodynia and difficulty feeding."
Symptomatic parents in the previous week.
"At the entrance: oxygen saturation 99%, normal blood tests."
"Chest X-ray: examination performed in appendectomy projection, with patient sitting"
accentuation of the lung plot; no pleural effusion.
"He is discharged after a few days in good condition, in fiduciary home isolation."
CASE 4
"Teenager, male, 17 years old with fever, cough, mild wheezing and chest tightness."
"At the entrance: 98% oxygen saturation, slightly elevated polymerase chain reaction blood chemistry."
"Mother with suspected symptomatology for COVID, waiting for nasopharyngeal swab, then confirmed positive."
"Chest X-ray: examination performed in appendectomy projection, with patient sitting"
slight pulmonary thickening in the middle paracardiac site; no pleural effusion.
Start therapy with antiretroviral and hydroxychloroquine.
Patient discharged after 3 days in fiduciary home isolation.
CASE 5
5-week-old male infant with fever and suspected urinary tract infection.
Parents and grandmother with suspected symptomatology for COVID; mother and grandmother tested positive for nasopharyngeal swab.
At the oxygen saturation input 100%; blood chemistry tests indicative of urinary tract infection.
"Chest X-ray: examination performed in appendectomy projection, in the supine patient"
accentuation of the peribroncovascular pulmonary design in the absence of parenchymal thickenings; no pleural effusion.
"Patient discharged after 3 days of hospitalization for treatment of urinary tract infection, in fiduciary home isolation."
"It is now known that SARS-CoV-2 infection is possible in pediatric patients, but generally has a benign, uncomplicated course."
"We have found only in one case, in advanced adolescence, a picture of pneumonia with radiographic characteristics not frankly typical, as is observed in adult patients, for which it was not considered necessary an HRCT study, given the good clinical conditions, while an x-ray check is scheduled."
