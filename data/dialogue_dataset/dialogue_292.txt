Doctor:
In brief:   Isolate sick people   Throat pain can be from a strep throat (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza, or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants.   Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. The flu or COVID-19 usually have cough, fever, body aches; whereas strep is mainly sore throat. Can call doctor by video or phone. (3/25/20)  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
