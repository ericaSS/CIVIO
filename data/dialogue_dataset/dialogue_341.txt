Description
Hi,my sinuses usually act up during seasonal change (like now). My worry is my symptoms resemble that of covid-19. Throat has been a bit irritated, lately nose has been runny. Wanted to know how I could get myself tested as I don’t live alone, thanks?

Doctor:
In brief:   No   If you know you have seasonal allergy treat that.   Get as much medicine as you might need for a month regarding this. If you do not fit criteria (google) then no testing for now. Stay home and stay safe.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
