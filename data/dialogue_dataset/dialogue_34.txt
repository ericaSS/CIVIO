Can pneumonia cause blood in urine?

Dialogue
Patient:
My father recently passed over the weekend. His body was fighting an infection along with pneumonia for 1 week. During that time, he would urinate bloody urine into the foley. The doctors said that was completely normal. It was very dark red. Is that normal?
Doctor:
Hello,
 * The pneumonia does not give rise to red urine called hematuria.
* There can be possible causes for red blood cells in the urine as
 - uncontrolled urinary tract infection
- kidney damage via systemic sepsis
- abnormal clotting factors or platelet function
- side effects of drugs
- dehydration related
- secondary effects of diabetes
- others
 * Kindly share all reports if available with you for further discussion ahead and guide in details.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
 Take care
 Regards,
Dr Bhagyesh V. Patel, General Surgeon
