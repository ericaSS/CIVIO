Doctor:
Yes. Protection. It is not enough symptoms to say that you are a suspect case of COVID19; but, independently of this, if you have been in contact with a case, or you present persistent cough (with or without sputum), shortness of breath, wheezing, or you have a chronic disease like diabetes, hypertension, low immune system or cancer, should ask for medical attention. And use all the protection measures.
