Description
Do I just go to a Dr to determine if it's a sinus infection or do I go get tested for COVID first? To not risk anyone in practice?

Doctor:
In brief:   Phone triage.   Call your GP's office for instructions and identify local resources.   Your symptoms are suggesting sinusitis (other causes still possible) that is frequently viral and self limited. Local regulations should also be followed in such circumstances. Self quarantine will work for all in trying to prevent the spread. Hydration and rest will also work regardless of what the cause for your symptoms is.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
