Patient:

Doctor:
Yes. Avoid contact but ensure that they have food, supplies and able to slay at home. They should drink fluids and if they develop a fever, please call your PCP right away and also consider a virtual appointment with HT. Other symptoms to watch for include dry cough and shortness of breath. Use good hand washing and disinfect surfaces.
