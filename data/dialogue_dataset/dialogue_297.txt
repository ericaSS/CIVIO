Patient:
When is it justified to isolate (not talking about the lock down) for COVID-19? Which symptoms justifies it?
Doctor:
In brief:   Any contagiousness   A person with any signs of respiratory infection or gastrointestinal infection should be isolated to prevent spread of his infection.   Allergies can cause symptoms similar to infection symptoms, which means a person with allergy symptoms at this pandemic time should also be isolated. Note that if every person is isolated for 3-4 weeks, the pandemic stops because virus transmission stops.  (3/25/20)  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
