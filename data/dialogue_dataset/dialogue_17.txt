Dialogue
Patient:
11 year old has a cough, runny nose, headache,earache, no fever. Is this COVID-19?
Doctor:
The symptom pattern is not specific to one agent.
It suggests a cold and ear infection. Kids have been among those least affected by Covid-19 . Only proper screening and testing could confirm or exclude this or any other agent. Parainfluenza, rhinovirus, or RSV would be more likely.
