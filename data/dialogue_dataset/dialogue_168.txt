Suggest treatment for pneumonia and costochondritis

Dialogue
Patient:
Yes I had pneumonia and now have Costochondritis. I am just wondering if it will ever go away. I am active and miss my workouts. Every time I try to start working out it comes back. Will I ever be able to work out again? It has been since April when I had pneumonia and I still am dealing with this. YYYY@YYYY
Doctor:
Do you have diagnosed it correctly ? Go for HRCT CHEST , or Bronchoscopy for same. take i.v. antibiotics and then oral. complete course of antibiotics. For costochondritis apply analgesics ointment on it along with systemic anti inflammatory drugs. Get done diagnosis proper. You will definitely able to work again.
