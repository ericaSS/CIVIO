Doctor:
In brief:   Usually an infection   New throat symptoms can be from strep throat infection, a cold or the flu, or from another cause such as allergies, irritants, or coronavirus.   Usually, a person sees the doctor if symptoms is bothersome, recurrent, or don't go improve in a few days. COVID-19 infections tend to have chest cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain. Can call Dr. on video or phone.
