Description
Wanted to find out whether I should get tested for Covid 19. Had a slight fever last week Wednesday, slight dry cough and extra phlegmy. Symptoms are inconsistent though. I use the gautrain to get to work, was concerned that I could've been exposed.

Symptoms. Symptoms lasting for a week that are getting better sounds like process is resolving. Covid testing would not be indicated. You should follow the following guidelines:  https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines/preventing-covid-19.
