My 8 year old and 6 year old woke up yesterday with a bad cough, I've been giving them cough medication, Allergex and they are wearing the face masks in the house. Please advise how can I get them tested for Covid19?

Doctor:
In brief:   No testing now   YOur children are going to be fine, there have not been any children that have required drastic measures.   MAke sure you stay 2 m away and wash hands and surfaces, disinfect surfaces constantly. Ask questions on here, we are here buy you need to stay home right now.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
