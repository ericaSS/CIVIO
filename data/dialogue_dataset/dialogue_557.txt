Description
I'm just a bit concerned as I have a sore throat and coughing a little bit as a result of my sore throat. My upper body is also aching a bit. Is this a cause for concern?

Doctor:
Possible virus. This is likely a viral infection. If you have a fever and/or the cough or sore throat get worse, you should be examined by your doctor. If you've been exposed to a particular illness, such as strep or the flu or coronavirus, you may need to be tested.For now, rest, drink fluids, take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed if you have no medical contraindication.
