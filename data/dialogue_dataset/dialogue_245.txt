Dialogue
Patient:
Coronavirus how do we test?
Doctor:
In brief:   Lab if necessary   Most commercial labs such as Lancet, Ampath and Pathcare can test.   But the labs are stretched and test kits in short supply. Only tests if:You have symptoms that are not resolvingYou have been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19You have traveled from a high risk area  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
