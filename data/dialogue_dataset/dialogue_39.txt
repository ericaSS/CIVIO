Description
How long is a person with pneumonia contagious?

Dialogue
Patient:
I ve been diagnosed with pneumonia (I am 63) on Monday evening. My daughter (31) is exhibiting the same symptoms - went to her doctor and currently taking Z-Pak. I was prescribed azithromysin 500 mg for 5 days. I was concerned since we were experiencing the same symptoms. We spend time together but she is married and lives in town. I am married and my husband is not experiencing any symptoms. Totally confused. Is there a way to know if you have a viral or bacterial pneumonia. I have had all kinds of different blood work done, chest x-ray, - can they tell? How long is pneumonia contagious? She has 2 children and we re trying to figure out if it s okay to have someone else watch the kids. They are not sick at this time.
Doctor:
Hello,
 Usually, he is contagious one week before treatment and until three days after treatment.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
 Take care
 Regards,
