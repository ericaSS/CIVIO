Below is our contribution with a small review of covid-19 + pediatric cases admitted to our facility.
All four children who came to our observation were previously healthy.
The average age of the children is 4.2 years (range: 3.5 months - 10.9 years).
"At the entrance, the clinical characteristics were varied:"
2 out of 4 children had high fever (39 Â°);
1 out of 4 history of malaise and loss of appetite;
"1 out of 4 completely asymptomatic, assessed as the son of Covid-19 + parents both hospitalized, then hospitalized accordingly for care reasons."
"Laboratory tests showed modest lymphopenia, below normal values, only in a patient with fever."
The three symptomatic children showed a slight rise in lactate dehydrogenase
On chest X-ray:
3 out of 4 children had findings of substantial normality (Cases 1-3);
"1 out of 4, with fever, showed focal pulmonary thickening with minimal associated pleural effusion, of a not frankly consolidative type, characterized by minute, multiple confluent blotches (Case 4)."
None of the children underwent a chest computed/computerized tomography scan.
"The only positive thorax belonged to the child whose nasal swab had a low viral load, a finding framed by pediatric colleagues as a tail of Covid-19 infection, since the child already had fever and symptoms a week before presenting himself to our Pronto Pediatric aid."
Symptomatic children were treated with antibiotics and supportive care.
"This study shows, albeit the small number of cases, that even children can become infected with SARS-CoV-2, but with negative or minor respiratory pictures, in line with the data of the Literature collected so far, and in our experience, with hospitalization performed for an almost precautionary purpose."
