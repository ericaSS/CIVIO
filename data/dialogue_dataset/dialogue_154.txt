Suggest treatment for pneumonia

Dialogue
Patient:
I was recently diagnosed with Pneumonia. I had pneumonia when I was a baby but never since. I was shocked when I heard the diagnosis. The symptoms became apparent on March 28. I began taking Doxycycline Monohydrate on Monday April 3 and must take them for seven days. I am mega healthy and have not been sick in years. I can t even remember the last time I was sick. This has really knocked me out. I have zero energy and very little appetite. How does pneumonia manifest in the lung and how does bacteria get in there? How long will it be until I recover? I am really having a hard time with this. Help!
