Doctor:
In brief:   Periauricular pain    May be otitis ear infection or mastoiditis infection in the bone behind the ear.  Could call health tap prime  for  video assessment  and antibiotic prescription.   Sometimes you  may need IM or IV antibiotics.  Call Healthtap Prime or MD today ( even with corona ongoing you need treatment for this today).   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
