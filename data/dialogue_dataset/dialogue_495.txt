Description
Hi There. I was at a festival over this past weekend and there has been a report of someone testing positive now. Is it a good idea to go for a test and/or self isolate ? Is national travel by car ok ?

Doctor:
In brief:   Self-quarantine!    Enter self-quarantine then call your health care provider to get instructions regarding testing, self-quarantine and possible hospitalization then follow through!  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
