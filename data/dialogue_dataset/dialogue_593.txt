Description
Hi I am a health worker and a chronic asthmatic, is it easier for me to contract Corona? Will I survive it with my comorbidity? Should I ask for special leave during this time? I already feel my sinus blocked, very minor sore throat, seldom dry cough

Doctor:
In brief:   Check with PCP.   Data emerging from preliminary studies in France suggest a decades old medicine, chloroquine may be useful as a preventative drug.   It has been used to prevent malaria for decades & manufactures in the US have announced they are increasing production to meet an expected demand. Your status & what they are doing in your country should be answered by your doc.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
