Doctor:
In brief:   Viral syndrome   You're symptoms are likely viral syndrome; could be the flu, however, given the current COVID outbreak, it may very well be corona virus.    Please follow CDC guidelines for self quarantine.  Wash your hands frequently with soap and water.   Keep hydrated. Take tylenol for fever/pain.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
