Description
Hi I am 39 years old and returned from Germany 19 days ago. Yesterday I started getting a sore throat, runny nose. Today I have sinus pressure and a headache with a blocked nose, throat seems to be improving. Should I get tested. If so how?

Doctor:
Stay home. Stay at home, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature. Your symptoms are more consistent with a cold or sinus infection. Nasal saline and a decongestant may be helpful. If you develop COVID symptoms including dry cough, fever, and/or shortness of breath, testing is indicated. Report fever and shortness of breath to your PCP.
