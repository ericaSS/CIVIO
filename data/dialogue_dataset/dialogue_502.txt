Dialogue
Patient:
I have a sore throat, slight cough, tiredness. Should I get tested fro Covid 19?
Doctor:
In brief:   Maybe. Do video w/Dr   Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza (antibiotics usually not used), or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants.   Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
