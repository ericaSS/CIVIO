Description
Hi  I am a doctor working in a state hospital.  I have malaise, headache and a sore throat now for a week. My left eye also had conjunctivitis but the other symptoms do not resolve.   There is a covid 19 contact in our estate.   Should I test for it?

In brief:   HArd to say   If you have access to a telephonic consult then rather do that to start.   If you have access to testing you can do that. Do you have to work at the moment? I would discuss it with your consultant.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
