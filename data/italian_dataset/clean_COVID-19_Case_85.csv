"Female patient of 47aa, access to the pulmonary stenosis on 10/03/2020 for fever and dyspnea."
"APR: arterial hypertension, obesity (outcomes of bariatric surgery)"
Covid-19 positive swab.
"Chest x-ray (10/03/2020): single projection, patient sitting. Poor inspiration."
Gradient interstitial - alveolar infiltrates are recognized in the bilateral intercleidoilary site and in the right middle field. No pleural effusion. Cardiac transverse diameter increase.
"In relation to the X-ray finding, disease stratification is required by computed/computerized tomography"
"scan without contrast medium as per the internal company protocol, in agreement with the clinical colleagues of the Emergency"
Department with the attribution of a radiological score to quantify the extent of the disease.
Lung divided into 3 zones:
from the apexes to the hull
from the hull to the origin of the lower pulmonary veins
from the origin of the lower pulmonary veins to the diaphragm
"Each zone is assigned a score from 0 to 4 for both the right and left side, for a total of 24"
"points, with the following results:"
Absence of disease: 0 points
Disease extension <25%: from 1 to 6 total points
Disease extension 26-50%: 7 to 12 total points
Disease extension 51-75% from 13 to 18 total points
Disease extension> 76%: above 19 total points
Chest computed/computerized tomography (10/03/2020):
"widespread areas of altered bilateral parenchymal density are identified, with mantle and peribroncovascular distribution, more extensive in correspondence with both upper lobes; the extent of the disease is approximately 26 - 50% of the pulmonary parenchyma (radiological score: 10/24)."
No pleural effusion nor significant pericardial effusion.
"Multiple reactive lymph nodes in the upper paratracheal, bilateral and subcarinal areas."
Modest liver steatosis.
"Patient discharged in good compensation from our hospital, re-entered on 13/03/2020 due to worsening of clinical symptoms."
Laboratory tests (13/03): normal with the exception of mild leukopenia (lymphocytopenia).
EGA: pO2 46 mmHg; partial pressure ratio arterial oxygen / inhaled oxygen 221 (vn:> 300).
Chest x-ray (13/03):
Increase in extension of the multiple bilateral infiltrates that currently flow into parenchymal thickening in the middle III of the right lung and in multiple parenchymal consolidation patches on the left. Pleural effusion not recognizable.
"Subsequent hospitalization at the Intensive Care Unit, where the patient is intubated and subjected to mechanical ventilation."
"For worsening respiratory exchanges (EGA: pO2 51mmHg; partial pressure ratio of arterial oxygen / inhaled oxygen 64) and the appearance of diffuse swelling of soft tissues in the supraclavicular and bilateral laterocervical area, he carries out a new radiographic investigation."
"Chest x-ray (20/03/2020): single projection, Semi-sitting patient. Endotracheal cannula. central venous catheter"
"increase in bilateral interstitial alveolar infiltrates, more compact in the right perilary region."
Appearance of pneumomediastinum and soft tissue emphysema of the chest wall and at the base of the neck on the left.
Following the
"X-ray detection of pneumomediastinum and soft tissue emphysema in the radiographic investigation, a computed/computerized tomography investigation is required to better characterize the thoracic picture."
Chest computed/computerized tomography (20/03/2020):
clear progression of the extension of bilateral parenchymal alterations such as ground glass; the extent of the alterations described currently exceeds 75% of the lung volume.
Areas of extensive parenchymal consolidation with aerial bronchogram and bronchial distortions in correspondence of the middle lobe and both lower lobes.
"At the middle lobe in correspondence of the medial segment on the anterior mantle side presence of cystic alteration with thick walls, of about 30 millimeter, without sure continuity relationship with the airways; the alteration described shows characteristics compatible with pneumatocele."
"It pervades the main airways up to when assessable, without safe continuous solutions."
No obvious bilateral pneumothorax layers.
Discrete pneumomediastinum with extension to the thoracic cervical passage in continuity with important emphysema of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the neck and upper thoracic region.
Not pneumopericardium; the heart and large vessels maintain regular morphology and size.
"In the mediastinal area, some lymph node images with an immunoreactive aspect."
No pleural or pericardial effusion.
Normally positioned endotracheal cannula and nasogastric tube. central venous catheter with entry from right to distal end in the lumen of the vena cava superior to the confluence of the brachiocephalic venous trunk.
