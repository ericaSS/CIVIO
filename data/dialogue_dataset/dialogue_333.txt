Because I have type 1 diabetes, what is likely to happen to me if I get the coronavirus?

Dialogue
Patient:
Because I have type 1 diabetes, what is likely to happen to me if I get the coronavirus?
Doctor:
Might be more severe. People with diabetes can have more fragile immune systems with difficulty fighting infections, so if you contract coronavirus you might be at greater risk for breathing complications.  Any serious illness can affect blood sugar control in diabetics also. I recommend taking extra precautions to minimize contact with people so as to avoid contacting the virus.  .
