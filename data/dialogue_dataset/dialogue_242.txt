Description
I believe the incubation period for covid 19 is 7 days. So if you get sick after 7 days does the 14 say quarantine period starts from the moment you show symptoms or is the 7 days incubation period included in 14 day quarantine period?

Doctor:
After symptoms show. As per the NICD Guidelines for Clinical Management of Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Disease, "Those with mild disease may be de-isolated 14 days after symptom onset, while those with severe disease may be de-isolated 14 days after achieving clinical stability  (e.g. once supplemental oxygen is discontinued)".
