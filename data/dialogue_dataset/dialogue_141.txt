Patient:
I am recovering from Double Bilateral Pneumonia in hospital 3 days. I m an RT so I knew I had to use incentive spirometer and nebulizers for 2 weeks I am 2 weeks post discharge. I have to wear 02 at night only .5 to. 1 liter to keep sats above 90. During the day I occasionally need o2 I am on medical leave for 4 weeks is this going to get easier to breath soon I am resting as much as possible. I don t have much choice rather rest than feel pain I. Chest.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Pneumonia usually takes 2-3 weeks for complete recovery.Your oxygen requirement is decreasing. This is suggestive of recovery. So you will definitely be alright after 4 weeks. So get done repeat chest x ray to see how much pneumonia is recovered.Chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry are vital to achieve good lung functions after pneumonia.Don't worry, you will be alright.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
