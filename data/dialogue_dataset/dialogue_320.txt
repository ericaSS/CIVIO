Description
Daughter turned 1 yr on 20 March. Fever above 38 deg Celsius in the last couple months we alternated between  5ml Nurofen and 125mg Empaped (paracetamol) suppository every 4 hours till temp broke. Is Nurofen safe now regarding ibuprofen and COVID19?

Doctor:
In brief:   Basics   Fever is a normal body response when ill that increases circulation & oxygen supply to the tissues so natural healing comes faster.I would never treat minor fevers around 38 nor would I alternate  fever meds.  One or the other would be all I use when needed.  New data supports avoiding all ibuprofen products when corona virus may be present.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
