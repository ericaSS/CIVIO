Doctor:
Corona-virus. At 33 you may not need testing. You should isolate yourself.  Follow the following guideline: https://www.healthtap.com/blog/post/covid19-coronavirus-self-quarantine-guide  At this time I know you could contact someone through Healthtap, but the testing can be recommended, but no tests to do it. Let your local provider or health provider know. If you would have worsening SOB go to ER. .
