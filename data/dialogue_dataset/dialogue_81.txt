What causes coughing up dark phlegm while treating pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I had a colonoscopy last Wednesday and aspirated. Ended up in the emergency department and diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia.I am on antibiotics now. I am able to breathe better than yesterday but I am still coughing a lot, at times producing dark phlegm. And I am very tired. How long should I expect this to last? Thank you! Dani B
Doctor:
Hello,For your pneumonia, complete the course of antibiotic. Sputum culture and examination done if needed to do further work up.If your cough is not expelled properly, then cough expectorant syrup containing Ambroxol plus Terbutaline drug can be prescribed. Kindly attach your reports for giving more comment.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Parth Goswami
