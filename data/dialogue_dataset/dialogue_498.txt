Dialogue
Patient:
I have covid 19 symptoms but I’m not sure if I have it or it’s the flu?
Doctor:
Hard to guess. COVID-19 pandemic at this time, so a doctor on video may consult by video instead of requiring an in-person visit. Flu-like symptoms can be from a strep throat infection, a cold or influenza, or from some other cause like COVID-19. Usually, a person calls the doctor if the symptoms are bothersome, serious, recurrent, or persistent. COVID-19 testing depends on local availability. (3/22/20)
