Description
I'm quite sure that I have Covid-19. My mother is a health worker that has been exposed. Among my symptoms is trouble breathing and pain in the chest. Can I sleep and see how I feel tomorrow or is there a risk that I'll stop breathing in the night?

Doctor:
Seek help. Contact to your doctor or go to ER for trouble to breath. If you go to ER they test you for covid 19. Your mother also can be  tested if symptomtic.
