Doctor:
Avoid cold/ice... Though untreated WPW Syndrome can be regarded as pre-existing chronic condition, there is no current evidence that one is more susceptible to Covid-19, an infectious disease mostly transmitted through Respiratory Fluid Droplets. Best to follow WHO/CDC guideline on hygiene. Plus avoid cold/ice  drinks/foods. Drink warm water/tea, even chicken soup. Aleve or ibuprofen can be helpful for fever/soreness.
