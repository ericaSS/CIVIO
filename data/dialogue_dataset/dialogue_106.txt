Suggest therapy for pneumonia

Dialogue
Patient:
I am 33 years old, I was diagnosed with pneumonia almost a month ago after a short period of low grade fever and dry cough. Even after treatment with 4 courses of antibiotics dry cough has not resolved.I am having pain on the right lower side of the rib which is constant and experiencing back pain and pains all over my back and chest in a nonspecific pattern. A chest CT was performed and found subsegmental consolidatory changes in the anterior and lateral basal segments of right lower lobe with bronchial wall thickening, minimal ground glass opacification in the adjacent posterior and medial basal segments, few small mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, plus few lymph nodes seen in the pretracheal region, few of them showing dense calcification.My last lab report from december 23rd is as followsTOTAL COUNT-7200/cummNeutrophils-70%, Lymphocytes-28%, Eosinophils-2%ESR-28 mm/hr.Still I am having fatigue, dry cough and pains. What can it be?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more likely. Bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is common after pneumonia.And persistent dry cough and chest pain are mostly due to bronchitis.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
