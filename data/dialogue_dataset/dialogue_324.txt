If my wife (she is a nurse in a surgery) comes into contact with a patient with the virus, is she likely to then get it herself, if she is wearing gloves and mask etc?

Dialogue
Patient:

Doctor:
It is unlikely. Mefical personnel are trained to avoid these situations.Nevertheless recommend her to take off her clothes when she gets home and go directly to take a shower. Also is recommended to disinfect all the areas she touches before washing her hands, like door knobs and surfaces.
