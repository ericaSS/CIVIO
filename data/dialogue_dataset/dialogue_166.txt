Doctor:
Respected user, hi I evalauted your query thoroughly.Sorry to hear about the issue.*Prognosis depends on many factors - age - associated comorbid conditions   like heart attack / cv stroke / kidney malfunctions / diabetes - immunity  - haemoglobin level - body response to treatment - competency of doctors  - efficacy of molecules used in treatment & much more list not possible to  narrate whole here.*Considering all your narrations, her prognosis is guarded, not that much  good as normal person suffering from pneumonia recovering in days. - She may take very long time for recovery & may not recover also ( I pray   to God that doesn`t happen ) after your long jugglery with all ventilator   period. - I can suggest to see the progress of the patient on ventilator for 5-7 days   discuss with the consultant in details regarding this & then decide to    continue the treatment or wean her off from ventilator for resting her   sole in peace. Hope this clears your query. Thanks for using Health care magic & keeping trust in our medical services Regards
