What must I do if I have been in contact with a covid19 positive person?

Dialogue
Patient:
What must I do if I have been in contact with a covid19 positive person?
Doctor:
If real contact... Self-quarantine helps:  Stay at home, except for going to get medical care. Do not go to work, school, church, playgrounds, or other public areas. For medical care questions about your COVID-19 symptoms or other health issues, get advice from your doctor by video or phone.
