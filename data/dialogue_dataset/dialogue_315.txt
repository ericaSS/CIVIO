Doctor:
It will.... But it will take some time to break the chain of infection, to find a cure, and to find a vaccine. It is stressful for everyone. One way to look at it is that we are all in this together, irregardless of political party, race, or religion. As a people, we can overcome a simple virus and be stronger as a whole. You are not alone, millions of others share your concerns. Hang in there....
