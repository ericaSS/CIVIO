"Male patient, 49 years old, transported since 118 in pulmonary stenosis for fever and dyspnea for about 4 days; reports hyperpyrexia up to 39 ° and who takes Amoxicillin / Clavulanic acid for 2 days. In pulmonary stenosis pO2 saturation 94% and hyperpyrexia (38 °)."
"In the anamnesis, he does not report any noteworthy pathologies. Chest x-ray is required performed with a portable device positioned in a tensile structure specifically used outside the pulmonary stenosis"
CHEST X-RAY
"Chest x-ray demonstrates a modest but not particularly significant increase in interstitial texture; in view of the strong clinical suspicion, chest computed/computerized tomography is performed."
THORAX TC
"The computed/computerized tomography investigation shows the presence of multiple nuanced emery glass parenchymal thickenings located in the upper lobe of the right lung, in the middle lobe and in the lower lobe of both lungs in the subpleural area."
"The computed/computerized tomography findings, strongly suspected for a related inflammatory-infectious pathology COVID-19, suggest the disposition in isolation of the Pz and the execution of the nasopharyngeal swab (positive result for SARS-CoV-2)."
