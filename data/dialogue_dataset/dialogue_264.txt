Doctor:
Alcohol for Covid-19. Washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is extremely effective. Using an alcohol based hand sanitizer is a good second line of defense. Sanitizer contains emollient to help prevent dehydration. Straight alcohol doesn't. Follow all of the other published rules.
