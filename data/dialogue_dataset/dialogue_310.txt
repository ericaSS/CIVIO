Doctor:
In brief:   Odd comment   Since all countries have reported cases of Covid-19 the question is a bit inconsistent with current fact.   Any and all people should self quarantine if they had a known exposure in any setting. I would not consider anyone traveling from all areas either exposed or a risk to others. The hysteria of this idea is worse than the disease.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
