What causes a decrease in the WBC count while treating flu and pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
My daughter has been sick with the flu for over a week and now has Strep throat and pneumonia. She s saw her doctor, ran some tests and her white blood cell count keeps dropping. They just sent her to the ER. What would cause her wbc to drop? I know there s probably a few reasons, but given this recent background of her health?? Thank you. Very worried mom
Doctor:
Hello,Any infection if severe can suppress bone marrow. And this is responsible for low WBC (white blood cells) count. So better to start injectable antibiotics for control of infection. She may need leucovorin injection to stimulate bone marrow for producing WBCs. Once her infection is controlled, she will have a normal WBC count. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar
