Doctor:
In brief:   Self isolate   The current DOH guidelines are to self isolate.   If you develop fever, cough or shortness of breath, phone your local GP/ service provider and arrange for testing. If you have traveled overseas or have been in possible contact with someone with confirmed COVID 19, arrange testing. (wear a mask when going out if needed).
