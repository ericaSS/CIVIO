Patient:
My dr. Did a routine CNBC last week. His nurse called and my blood showed signs of anemia. Ok today his nurse called and the blood they deeper searched on showed: the disease of chronic pneumonia? Ok I do not have hiv/AIDS. My question is she said no cure. My mom died from a chronic infection in her longs acronym Boop. I contacted cdc.gov they put me in touch with center for rare diseases. No cure for mom. Question: the told me Boop was not genetically transferred. This is exactly how my moms lung diseases started. is thimy lung disease genetic? Is it curable? Help please
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Though BOOP (Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia ) is serious lung inflammatory condition, 65 - 80% of patients do respond well with corticosteroid therapy and cure. It is the remaining 20% of fatal cases which progress rapidly and have adverse outcomes.So, I do recommend to discuss the case and prognosis in details with his treating physician. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,      Dr. Bhagyesh V. Patel
