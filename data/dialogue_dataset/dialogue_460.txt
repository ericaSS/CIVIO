Can vaccines for coronavirus in domestic pets be modified for humans as a way to have a vaccine for covid-19?
Doctor:
In brief:   No    I really don't think so but its a very different virus as is the old corona we know - 5 varieties of the common cold are from coronaviruses  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
