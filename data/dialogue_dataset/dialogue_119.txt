Please type your query here...I had pneumonia in Aug. of 2010, then again in Oct, of same year with fluid on my lung, this past week I started with sore head eyes and ears, within 2 days I started coughing and wheezing, went to urgent care, no temp.,b/p 148/84, o2 95, wbc low,3 was given antibiotic and inhaler. I still have bouts of coughing so much I get exhausted and a lot of wheezing, the wheezing is so bad , when I go to bed I am unable to sleep, should I return to urgent care or will this get better soon, thank you so much.
