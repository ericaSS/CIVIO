Dialogue
Patient:
Hello Doctor,
My mother is an asthamatic and diabetic and has been suffering from pneumonis and being treated an MAdam Mohan MAlviya hospital in Malviya Nagar Delhi. The doctors there have recomended for a HRCT test done for her chest.
 Cld u recomend the hospital where we shld go for this test?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. HRCT thorax is done at radiology center. So ask your doctor about near by CT scan centers.Usually CT scan is not required for diagnosis of pneumonia.But in some cases if diagnosis is not confirmed or patient is not improving or we suspect TB or ILD (interstitial lung disease) then HRCT thorax is advised.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.
