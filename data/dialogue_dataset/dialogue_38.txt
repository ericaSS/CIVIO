Dialogue
Patient:
Hi my husband has been diagnosed with pneumonia and given roxithromycin, he s had a heart transplant 4 yrs ago he is very tired hardly eating or drinking pretty larthargic to be honest should I be taking him to hospital we are now on day 3 on the antibiotics with no improvement what would you suggest?
Doctor:
Hi,
 Yes, you should definitely take him to the hospital, seeing that he is especially vulnerable as a heart transplant recipient. 
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Dr. Anders Mark Christensen, General Surgeon
