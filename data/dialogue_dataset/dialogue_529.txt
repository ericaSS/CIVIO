Description
Are children with a respiratory pathology at greater risk for Covid-19 (since there are so little cases of children getting the virus, but still their natural history could be an issue)?

Dialogue
Patient:
Are children with a respiratory pathology at greater risk for Covid-19 (since there are so little cases of children getting the virus, but still their natural history could be an issue)?
Doctor:
Be very cautious . There is not a lot of information on children with COVID-19 but definitely would try to protect this child especially and consult the doctor ASAP if child develops fever and shortness of breath.
