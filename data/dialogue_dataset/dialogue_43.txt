Dialogue
Patient:
My son has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and started a five day treatment today. He is 11 years old and very lean almost under weight. He hasn t been eating well this week and coughing is pristant as of today. I believe he should not go on the ice. He does play hard. can I get your opinion?
Doctor:
Hello,
 As you explain the history for giving you a correct opinion I should see his chest X-ray and blood tests.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
 Take care
 Regards,
Dr Jnikolla, Pulmonologist
