Description
Good morning I have sore throat for 2 days now, this morning I woke up and my throat was a lot better just a little scratchy. My other symptoms this morning were stuffy nose and a bit on the sore side with my body?

Doctor:
Likely not corona. Sounds more like seasonal allergy or a mild cold. GArgle with warm salt water and use meds you have at home. Ask questions on this forum - don't go out unless you really really have to.
