62 year old male patient
"Remote history changes, not copatologies."
"Onset with asthenia, dry cough and 3 days serotin fever."
pO 2 = 97% in air; polymerase chain reaction = 0.75.
The chest radiogram does not show pathological findings
"In relation to the discrepancy between the clinical picture and radiological signs, it is decided to perform computed/computerized tomography"
"Standard computed/computerized tomography, reconstruction with lung algorithm on axial and coronal images. Only a few nuanced bilateral alveolar infiltrative thickens are observed in a picture of interstitial-alveolar pneumonia at onset."
Buffer for COVID-19 tested positive after the presumptive diagnosis with computed/computerized tomography
