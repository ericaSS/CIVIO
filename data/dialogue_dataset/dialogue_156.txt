Suggest treatment for persistent pneumonia

Dialogue
Patient:
my friend suffers from diagnosed bronchiectias and gets pneumonia constantly.  She is 72  Each time they give her antibotics for a week and then the xray will show the pneumonia gone, however, it contantly returns.  She has been to Mayo, Iowa City   had many test.  It's beginning to take a toll on her.  I would say she had pneumonia about 6 times last year and so far 2 or 3 this year.  Any suggestions
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Bronchiectesis is permanently damaged part of lung. So bacterial colonization is common in bronchiectesis. And this gives repeated pneumonia attacks. So best and permanent cure for this is surgical removal of bronchiectic part of lung. So consult Cardio thoracic surgeon and discuss about surgical removal. Another option is culture and sensitivity based treatment. Get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture will identify the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your friend. Thanks.
