What are symptoms of pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I recently got over either the flu or pnemonia. I've noticed my feces are increasingly yellow or whitish. I had quit smoking thrity days ago and have been on the nicotine gum and now the lozenges. I don't feel bad, but this is unusual. Could the nicotine products be contributing to the discoloration? Thank you.
Doctor:
HiIf a patient have pneumonia he should have cough with or without sputum,probably chest pain and breathlessness,anorexia,fever.But the signs and symptoms varies from patient to patient.Take careDr.jolanda
