Hello, I would like assistance with managing a ongoing cough that may or may not be linked to Corona virus. A colleague stated their possible exposure to someone who tested positive. The cough started more than a week ago.  ?

Doctor:
In brief:   Cough/fever?   Please stay at home and avoid contact with others for one more day at least.   If there is a fever, remain at home for at least three days after the fever is gone. At this point, if you are otherwise healthy, cover your cough, monitor your temperature and please stay home.Watch for signs of secondary infection, including fever, worsening cough and shortness of breath.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
