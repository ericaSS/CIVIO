"Male patient, 70 years old, suffering from high risk myelodysplastic syndrome, already under treatment and hematological follow-up. Arterial hypertension (under pharmacological treatment) and carotid atheromasia."
"He arrives at the emergency room with a clinical symptomatology characterized by fever (38.5 - 39 ° C) for about four days, dry cough, dyspnoea and persistent chest pain."
EO: mitral valve significantly reduced in both lung areas.
EGA: hypoxia. oxygen saturation: 80%.
ECG: absence of suggestive alterations for ischemia.
"He reports that he did not have contact with known positive Covid-19 patients, nor that he had previously been in the territories declared as red zone in Northern Italy."
"Laboratory tests: Leukopenia. Thrombocytopenia. Anemia. Increase in polymerase chain reaction, lactate dehydrogenase and procalcitonin values. The D-Dimer and troponin values ​​were within the limits."
Chest X-ray (projection in forced supine position):
Presence of extensive and nuanced parenchymal thickening in correspondence of the middle-upper pulmonary field on the right. There are other parenchymal thickenings projecting at both lower lung fields. Partial pleurogenic obliteration of the SCF. Cardiac shadow within limits. Atheromatous calcifications of the aortic button.
"The X-ray examination is completed, in urgency, by a chest computed/computerized tomography study, performed under basal conditions and with a high resolution algorithm (HRCT), with 64Multislices equipment, whose images obtained were analyzed with a 1.2 millimeter slice-thickness and subsequent MPR reconstructions, which confirmed the presence of extensive parenchymal thickening with a frosted glass appearance, occupying most of the upper lobe on the right. Other parenchymal thickenings, ground glass were identifiable in correspondence of the dorsal region of the LSS and the apical segment of the LIS."
"Similar, smaller densities were identifiable at the basal dorsal regions of both lower lobes. Cardiac image within limits. No evidence of pericardial effusion."
"In the meantime, the result of the SARS-CoV-2 buffer arrived: positive."
"The patient is thus hospitalized at the UOC of Infectious Diseases of our Hospital, Covid reference HUB for the entire province of Reggio Calabria, both promptly establishing multi-drug therapy and O2-therapy, and constantly evaluating its clinical parameters and laboratory, also given its serious underlying pathology, together with colleagues Hematologists."
"After five days, his clinical condition worsened considerably, despite the treatment, so much that he had to be intubated urgently. Laboratory tests continued to be altered, most of the inflammation indexes and procalcitonin."
"Therefore, chest x-ray was performed (projection in forced supine position, in the ward) and, after 72 hours, HRCT control investigation."
"Chest x-ray was worsened compared to entry, as parenchymal pulmonary thickening increased, now presenting a tendency to confluence, up to bilateral complete pulmonary opacation (more evident on the right). There was also bilateral interstitial involvement, of a reticulo-micronodular character. Cardiac shadow within limits."
"HRCT demonstrated the presence of extensive and multiple thickening / consolidating areas, partly confluent, multifocal, affecting both lungs, with greater evidence in the upper lobar site on both sides. There was widespread background grinding of lung density, with associated bilateral reticular and interstitial thickening. The pleural effusion on both sides had increased (more evident on the right). Some augmented lymph node subcentimeters were identified in the ilo-mediastinal site. No evidence of pericardial effusion. Cardiac image within limits."
"In Intensive Care the patient was treated by continuous positive airway pressure (to which he replied discreetly), continuing and reinforcing the already set multi-drug therapy."
"It was observed and closely monitored in its vital parameters, with a slow evolution of the clinical picture towards stability."
"The case presented demonstrates the usefulness of HRCT as well as in the early stages of diagnosis, also for evaluating the course and severity of the disease well, in the presence of other concomitant pathologies, thus directing towards the best clinical management of the patient."
