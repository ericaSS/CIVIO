Description
I am experiencing a sore throat, fever, headache and coughing. I have a bit of a runny nose, short breath but only from time to time. I have traveled on THE MCS Cruise to Mozambique 13-16 March 2020. I think it might be necessary to do a COVID-19?

Doctor:
Get tested. If you can not find a place to get tested self-quarantine yourself for 2 weeks. You can use over the counter drugs for symptomatic treatment in the mean time. If sore throat get worse this could be strep throat need a culture to be taken from your throat by your doctor followed by antibiotic. If shortness of breath gets worse call the hospital for the inpatient treatment could be for Covid-19.
