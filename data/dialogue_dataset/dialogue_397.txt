Need more info! Difficult to advise without more information, so seek evaluation by a doctor.  Because of covid, try to do that by phone/telemedicine.  However, seek care right away if difficulty breathing, or severe symptoms.Seek covid testing if known COVID-19 contact, or travel to high risk country, or youâ€™ve been in facility treating people with Covid-19, or if pneumonia.Call 0800 029 999 for test.
