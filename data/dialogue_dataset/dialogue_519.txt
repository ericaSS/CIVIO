Doctor:
In brief:   COVID-19 criteria   Do you have any medical conditions that would put you at high risk? If so, I would book a virtual consult with a dr. If not, we are not currently testing due to lack of capacity if there is no fever, dry cough & shortness of breath with travel history.   I would treat for flu and complete 14 days (possibly longer if still sick) quarantine and contact a dr if condition changes  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
