Description
If I inhale enough Lysol, will it keep me from getting sick from novel coronavirus?

Dialogue
Patient:
If I inhale enough Lysol, will it keep me from getting sick from novel coronavirus?
Doctor:
In brief:   Um, no   Inhaling Lysol can be deleterious to your health, more than COVID-19 itself.   Burning your pulmonary tissues may actually make you more susceptible to getting sick from the virus. Be rational.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
