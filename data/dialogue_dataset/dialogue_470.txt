Description
I know hand washing (20+ seconds) is best to kill coronavirus, and that if not available use sanitizer of 60%+ alcohol. I thought my sanitizer was but realized it's only 57.6%. Been using lots for weeks. I've stopped using it. Should I be worried?

Doctor:
In brief:   Life is not exact   In pandemic times, supplies are short.   Life is not that exact. That means 57.6% is fine, and if a person catches the coronavirus, it won't be because she was missing 2% on her hand sanitizer. Remember that the virus goes from person to person. If there are no people close by, and if the high-touch surfaces like table tops, keyboards, or doorknobs are clean, then one is a lot safer.
