Description
How can pneumonia be managed while suffering from COPD?

Dialogue
Patient:
My sister, age 72, and living alone drove herself to an emergency room at 4:00 a.m. with temperature of 101+, chills and a little dizziness. They diagnosed her with pneumonia. She has COPD and uses inhalers and oral meds. I am concerned because she just told me she is extremely tired and has been under a lot of stress due to move from home of 45+ years, family concerns and loss of husband 2 years ago. She had hip replacement three months ago. I live an hour and a half away and am wondering if I should drive to her city and check on her. She does have a son and a neighbor friend looking in on her.
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 She is already suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease). And pneumonia can be severe in already compromised lungs. So pneumonia in COPD patients should be treated promptly. And hence she needs hospital admission, Intravenous antibiotics, anti pyretic, Intravenous fluids and other supportive drugs. So better to admit her and start appropriate treatment.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
