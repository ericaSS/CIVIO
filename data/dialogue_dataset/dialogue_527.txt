Doctor:
In brief:   High temperature   COVID stands for 'COrona VIrus Diesase'.   We know that high temperature kills most pathogens eg protozoa, viruses and bacteria. That's why cooking is recommending for certain foods rather than eating it 'raw'. Temperatures of 140 to 160 degree F kills most pathogens including viruses. Corona viruses are sensitive to heat and cooking will destroy the outer protein layer and kill the virus.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
