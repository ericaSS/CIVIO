Doctor:
In brief:   Coronavirus.    Yes, according to previous knowledge, most virus including coronavirus likely will not survive hotter climates.   I would expect or hope this will die down in summer time. Nevertheless, this is new coronavirus, let's wait and see. I also think that with strong human intervention, the virus may reduce or be eliminated before summer.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
