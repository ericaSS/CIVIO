Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Maybe pneumonia didn't resolve. You have to change medications. Add Azithromycin, syrup Ascoril thrice and tablet Pantop D twice. Also take Mucaine gel twice. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,      Dr. Chandra Shekhar
