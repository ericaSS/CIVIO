Evolution of acute inflammatory lung damage in fibrotic structural modifications of the parenchyma with honeycombing-like pattern.
Immune-mediated inflammatory damage + mechanical ventilation-induced barotrauma damage? Reversible or irreversible?
"Chest computed/computerized tomography will assume a further strategic role in understanding covid pathology by studying, with the help of the clinic and specific pneumological tests, any lung changes in patients recovered from severe pneumonia."
