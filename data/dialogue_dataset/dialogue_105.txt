What causes pneumonia with spiking temperatures?

Dialogue
Patient:
My friend had pneumonia a few weeks ago and was given cipro and flagl antibiotics.  She had to return to the hospital two more time because of spiking temperatures.  Fluid was tested from her lungs and came back negative.  Could she possibly have contacted mersa?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Repeated spiking temperatures (fever) in pneumonia patient is suggestive of nonresolving pneumonia.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture report will isolate the causative organism (if it is MRSA or other bacteria) and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment.He may need higher antibiotics on the basis of sensitivity report. By this, we can achieve speedy recovery. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your friend. Thanks.
