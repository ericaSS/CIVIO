Description
I'm currently have a semi emerging wisdom tooth that is sharp and growing against my inner cheek causing slight discomfort. What can I do to ease the discomfort at home since I can't have the surgery to remove the tooth now due to covid lockdown?

Doctor:
NSAIDs. OTC NSAIDs can help with pain and inflammation. Please try calling a local oral surgeon. Most medical offices are open for emergencies only, and this probably falls into that category.
