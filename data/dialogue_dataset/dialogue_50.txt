How can pneumonia and pleurisy be treated?

Dialogue
Patient:
I was diagnosed with pneumonia and pleurisy Friday 6/22/18.  Dr gave me Azithromiacin and 800mg of ibuprofen .  That was 4 days ago.  Azithromiacin has one pill left, and i no longer take the ibuprofen as not needed.  To date, I take Sudafed PE and Robitussin DM with expectorant & suppressant.  Every 4 hours when the meds wear off, my fever returns with body aches, chills, headache, and coughing. I continually cough up flem, and when lying down need to clear my throat every 30 seconds. I'm also bloated and get air bubbles under my ribs that are painful.
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
 * As far as my clinical experience is concerned, the intensity of the symptoms are not under control with oral antibiotics.
* In our clinic, I recommend the patient to get hospital admission, start intravenous antibiotics, broncho dilators and other supportive measures to control the same. Do give me further chance to assist in future.
 Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
