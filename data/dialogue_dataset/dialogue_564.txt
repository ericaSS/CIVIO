Doctor:
In brief:   Yes   I would advise screening due to your exposure.   Fever is very commonly associated with COVID-19. Stay at home, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature. Arrange the testing which also  may include a chest image with your PCP.  Since your have been traveling, a pulmonary embolism is another possible cause of your shortness of breath.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?
